# Points

1. Giver Vs Taker
- When takers win, there‚Äôs usually someone else who loses.
    - Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways to knock them down a notch.
    - Takers tend to be **self-absorbed, they‚Äôre more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me ‚Äîversus first-person plural pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves**.
    - In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21 percent of CEOs‚Äô first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four were about themselves alone and no one else.
    - The **taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives** in their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.
    - In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms **had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger losses.** The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy. Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put their companies in jeopardy.
    - [Giver and Taker](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97) On the left side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about me. A big photo is self-glorifying.
- When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than gunning for them.
    - Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.
1. Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse skills, and power.
- By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to knowledge, expertise, and influence.
1. At some point in your life, you‚Äôve probably experienced the frustration of dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a favor, but end up stabbing you in the back‚Äîor simply ignoring you‚Äîafter they get what they want. **This faker style of networking** casts the entire enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.
2. When **people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational information**. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as **their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning bridges with potential new ties**.

# Storys

---

Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer‚Äôs help, Rifkin became enamored with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech server. ‚ÄúIt was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the music.‚Äù The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.

# Meaning

1. **Lekking** - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.
- When it‚Äôs time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even do acrobatics.

# Points

- Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts.
- They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities.
- They learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.
- The more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example.
- Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity.
- **Learn with Mix things** not a Single thing.
- The more likely an expert was to have his or her predictions featured on op-ed pages and television, **the more likely they were always wrong.**
- The best forecasters view their own ideas as **hypotheses in need of testing.**
    - Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, **but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions.**
- Crew leadership not as decision making, but as sensemaking.
    - If I make a decision, it is a possession, I take pride in it, I tend to defend it and not listen to those who question it.
    - If I make sense, then this is more dynamic and I listen and I can change it.

# Storys

Dark horses were on the hunt for match quality. “They never look around and say, ‘Oh, I’m going to fall behind, these people started earlier and have more than me at a younger age,’”

Ogas told me.

“They focused on, ‘Here’s who I am at the moment, here are my motivations, here’s what I’ve found I like to do, here’s what I’d like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which of these is the best match right now? And maybe a year from now I’ll switch because I’ll find something better.’”

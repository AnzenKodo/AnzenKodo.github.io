1. Code is more about People then line.
2. Bad Tools can waste your time sometimes.
3. Don‚Äôt be religious about your tools it is just a tool not a human even a living thing.
4. Nobody cars about your code
- You can use whatever coding language or framework you want it is just a line of code that can change by anybody. It is doesn‚Äôt matter that much.
- It‚Äôs all about the product. The user cares about what you‚Äôve built and how it solves their problem, not so much about how you got there.
1. Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of development.
2. If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you‚Äôre aware of that possibility.
3. Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.
4. Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks have conventions for how things are organized.
5. Consistent code style. It doesn‚Äôt matter what styles you choose.
6. start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù web page, a metric unit converter.
7. Burned out
- I didn‚Äôt want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.
- You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay
- Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.
- Keep your personal life separate from your work life.
1. Be the change you wish to see in our industry.
2. What I call myself
- Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower than Junior Software Developer.
- The programmer is a term that‚Äôs gone the way of the dinosaur.
- The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If your job involves building condominiums, you‚Äôre reading the wrong book.
- Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally I‚Äôve heard it defined in contradictory ways.
- JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good name.
1. DevOps
- The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and operations people.
- The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny operating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely portable.
- If you don‚Äôt understand something, Google it. If you can‚Äôt figure it out easily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.
- If someone has told you otherwise, you‚Äôre in the wrong company. Automate as much as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far more time-consuming.
- Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need to keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.
1. If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce these expenses dramatically.
2. Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements change or a solution already exists.
3. Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.
4. Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the ‚Äúbest way‚Äù to do something.
5. The three virtues.
- Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don‚Äôt have to answer so many questions about it.
- Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don‚Äôt just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
- Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won‚Äôt want to say bad things about.

# Q&A

1. When you‚Äôre first reading about something new in code.
- Why is this important or useful?
- How does it fit with other topics or technologies?
- What‚Äôs the problem that it‚Äôs trying to solve?

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Anything You Want</h1>
<p>Author: Derek Sivers
Created time: March 21, 2021 12:38 AM
Page No.: 96
Progress: ✔️</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start teaching someone something and that you business starts.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Clients of Your Business
<ul>
<li>The Problem with big clients like Google, Microsoft &amp; Apple.
<ul>
<li>You have to custom-tailor your product to please a very few specific people.</li>
<li>Those people might change their minds or leave the company.</li>
<li>Whom are you really working for? Are you self-employed or is this client your boss?</li>
<li>If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.</li>
<li>By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose wants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good thing about small clients.
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to change what you do to please one client; you need to please only the majority (or yourself).</li>
<li>If one client needs to leave, it’s OK; you can sincerely wish her well.</li>
<li>Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).</li>
<li>You hear hundreds of people’s opinions and stay in touch with what the majority of your clients want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes happy &amp; fulfilling.</li>
<li>When you are at something great you don’t feel something big going to happen.</li>
<li>You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.</li>
<li>Business improvement.
<ul>
<li>Customers satisfaction.
<ul>
<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</li>
<li>Make every decision even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone according to what’s best for your customers.</li>
<li>If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important things to remember.
<ul>
<li>Don’t let other people play with your fear. Like Saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios. Those are just sales tactics.</li>
<li>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</li>
<li>Don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>
<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. <strong>It’s a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.</strong></li>
<li>You don’t need something big to improve the business sometimes it’s little things that’s add up.</li>
<li>People remember you more for the smile that you put on there face then fancy business stuff.</li>
<li>Always prepare for 2x because anytime it can come.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Employed VS Business Owner
<ul>
<li>Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles.</li>
<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solve problems
<ul>
<li>Before trusting someone verify that they can do the job.</li>
<li>Why businesses keep problems around? (Like- Nord VPN)
→A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.</li>
<li>If the company has a problem with your decisions then explain your thought process and philosophy.</li>
<li>If you are an owner of the company you can be anything. And if don’t feel like doing something then give the role to someone who loves doing that role.</li>
<li>Don’t freedom but don’t give too much that they can overturn you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start now. No funding needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal improvement.
<ul>
<li>Don’t follow other people path without making your own path.</li>
<li>Don’t spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them you should want.</li>
<li>If present is worse than past, then move back and restart improving where things are good.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.</li>
<li>Doing work yourself is inefficient but it is what make it so joyful in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derek Sivers philosophies of Business.
<ul>
<li>Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.</li>
<li>Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.</li>
<li>When you make a company, you make a utopia. It’s where you design your perfect world.</li>
<li>Never do anything just for the money.</li>
<li>Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.</li>
<li>Your business plan is moot. You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.</li>
<li>Starting with no money is an advantage. You don’t need money to start helping people.</li>
<li>You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.</li>
<li>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</li>
<li>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>That one silly e-mail, sent out with every order, has been so loved that if you search Google for “private CD Baby jet,” you’ll get almost twenty thousand results. Each one is somebody who got the email and loved it enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers.

<p>We answered our phone within two rings, always 7am to 10pm, seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>

<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 9:01 PM Page No.: 146
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>A philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate,
resourceful, and connected.</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make database of people &amp; and how often I should contact them.</li>
<li>Build some persona for people to look up to.</li>
<li>Never give to I am contacting someone.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>How to use friends database?
<ul>
<li>Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.</li>
<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>
<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>
<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have
their correct info.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Normal World &amp; Business World
<ul>
<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they
don’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a
total loser.</li>
<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,
you’re a loser!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to be cool?
<ul>
<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal
boring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had
the courage.</li>
<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but
it’s considerate and part of your art.</li>
<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only
great at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>
<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them
curious.</li>
<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme
character. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About People
<ul>
<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>
<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a
friend. That’s how things are done</li>
<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that
thing is popular.</li>
<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with
your existing contacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business
<ul>
<li>How beat competitor?
<ul>
<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>
<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>
<li>Play a completely different game.</li>
<li>Be radically opposite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters
<ul>
<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.
Make sure they stick together as a group.</li>
<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not
yourself. Make it fun to join.</li>
<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are
having.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been
done.
<ul>
<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use
Amazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not
be able to imagine that niche without you.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your
attention</li>
<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that
it’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>
<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>
<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,
competition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,
being a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that
you’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate
to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>
<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was
completely ignored.</p>
<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d
received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a
second inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>
<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the
chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it
in a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare
time.</p>
<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the
third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a
conference.</p>
<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing
problem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to
get the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the
publisher.</p>
<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for
permission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they
contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>
<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>
<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>
<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They
love it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,
“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on
music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and
tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”
Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing
their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,
and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious
and overwhelming.</p>

<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>John T. Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would
do a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your
poem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?
It’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and
say, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your
life worth?”</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of
the International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family
were sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate
interest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced
major budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help
people connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said
Hadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day
activities.”</p>
<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>
<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him
set up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,
while performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered
questions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded
music, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his
teeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions
of people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t
normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN
SPACE!”</p>
<hr>
<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided
“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to
direct Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he
was held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to
die,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .
. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m
going to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>
<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the
throat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy
and life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a
permanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination
didn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer
George Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or
four days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in
it, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to
really have that</p>

<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to
treat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either
scribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward
computer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>
<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to
Facebook, and blogging at <a href="http://rogerebert.com/">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped
out posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about
everything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak
’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his
inevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,
and he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with
the world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>

✔️</p>
<ol>
<li>Code is more about People then line.</li>
<li>Bad Tools can waste your time sometimes.</li>
<li>Don’t be religious about your tools it is just a tool not a human even a
living thing.</li>
<li>Nobody cars about your code</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can use whatever coding language or framework you want it is just a line
of code that can change by anybody. It is doesn’t matter that much.</li>
<li>It’s all about the product. The user cares about what you’ve built and how it
solves their problem, not so much about how you got there.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of
development.</li>
<li>If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally
belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you’re aware of
that possibility.</li>
<li>Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.</li>
<li>Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks
have conventions for how things are organized.</li>
<li>Consistent code style. It doesn’t matter what styles you choose.</li>
<li>start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an “About Me” web page, a
metric unit converter.</li>
<li>Burned out</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.</li>
<li>You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or
long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay</li>
<li>Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.</li>
<li>Keep your personal life separate from your work life.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Be the change you wish to see in our industry.</li>
<li>What I call myself</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower
than Junior Software Developer.</li>
<li>The programmer is a term that’s gone the way of the dinosaur.</li>
<li>The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If
your job involves building condominiums, you’re reading the wrong book.</li>
<li>Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the
highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally
I’ve heard it defined in contradictory ways.</li>
<li>JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good
name.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and
operations people.</li>
<li>The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny
operating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely
portable.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand something, Google it. If you can’t figure it out
easily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.</li>
<li>If someone has told you otherwise, you’re in the wrong company. Automate as
much as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far
more time-consuming.</li>
<li>Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need
to keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce
these expenses dramatically.</li>
<li>Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements
change or a solution already exists.</li>
<li>Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.</li>
<li>Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the “best way” to do
something.</li>
<li>The three virtues.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall
energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people
will find useful and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so
many questions about it.</li>
<li>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you
write programs that don’t just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate
them. Or at least pretend to.</li>
<li>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other
people won’t want to say bad things about.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<ol>
<li>When you’re first reading about something new in code.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why is this important or useful?</li>
<li>How does it fit with other topics or technologies?</li>
<li>What’s the problem that it’s trying to solve?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<p>Author: Jordan Peterson

Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words.</li>
<li>We all have twice as many female ancestors as male (imagine that all the women who have ever lived have averaged one child. Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>
<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>
<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>
<li>About ourselves
<ul>
<li>Order &amp; Chaos
<ul>
<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>
<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>
<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rules
<ul>
<li>We are rule generators. Humans can’t live without rules.</li>
<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hierarchy of value
<ul>
<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>
<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emotions
<ul>
<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>
<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Women
<ul>
<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>
<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>
<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideologies
<ul>
<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>
<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>
<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meaning
<ul>
<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>
<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why we are not equal?
<ul>
<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>
<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>
<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>
<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why you compare yourself?
<ul>
<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>
<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>
<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>
<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>
<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who are you?
<ul>
<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>
<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>
<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>
<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>
<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>
<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>
<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>
<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>
<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What not to do?
<ul>
<li>Low self-worth people
<ul>
<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>
<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>
<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>
<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How internal critic puts you down?
<ul>
<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>
<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>
<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>
<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequence of remaining silent.
<ul>
<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>
<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>
<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What people do that they don’t think they do?
<ul>
<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>
<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>
<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manipulate the World
<ul>
<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>
<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>
<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>
<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to stop doing?
<ul>
<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>
<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>
<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>
<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>
<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>
<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Children
<ul>
<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>
<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About lies
<ul>
<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>
<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>
<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>
<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>
<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to
<ul>
<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>
<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>
<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women
<ul>
<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>
<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>
<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>
<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>
<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>
<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>
<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>
<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?
<ul>
<li>About Truth
<ul>
<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>
<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>
<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>
<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>
<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>
<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>
<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>
<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Self
<ul>
<li>Why to take care of yourself?
<ul>
<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>
<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>
<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>
<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>
<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to improve yourself.
<ul>
<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>
<li>Speak your mind.</li>
<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>
<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>
<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>
<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Improvement Steps
<ul>
<li>Start with yourself.</li>
<li>Take care with yourself.</li>
<li>Define who you are.</li>
<li>Refine your personality.</li>
<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>
<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to know yourself?
<ul>
<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>
<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>
<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?
<ul>
<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>
<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>
<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>
<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why life is a game?
<ul>
<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>
<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>
<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>
<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>
<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to win?
<ul>
<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>
<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>
<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture
<ul>
<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>
<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To improve your life aim small.
<ul>
<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>
<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>
<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>
<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?
<ul>
<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>
<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>
<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>
<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>
<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>
<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?
<ul>
<li>Tell the truth.</li>
<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listening to other people
<ul>
<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>
<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>
<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>
<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>
<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>
<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>
<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>
<li>Don’t blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>
<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>
<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>
<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>
<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>
<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>
<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>
<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship
<ul>
<li>Why we save people?
<ul>
<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>
<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>
<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>
<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why not help some people?
<ul>
<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>
<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>
<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?
<ul>
<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>
<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>
<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bad Friends
<ul>
<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>
<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>
<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>
<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>
<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>
<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Friends
<ul>
<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>
<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>
<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>
<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>
<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>
<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>
<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>
<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>
<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you. You need to give love before you re</strong>ce<strong>ive it.</strong></li>
<li>When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Culture
<ul>
<li>You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion.</li>
<li>You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.</li>
<li>The crowd is by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world and with the people you disagree with.</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> - Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>
<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>
<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>
<hr>
<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>
<hr>
<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>
<hr>
<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat with only 236 different words, so his editor
bet him he couldn’t write a book with only 50 different words. Dr. Seuss came
back and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s
books of all time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter
until my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed.
But instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try
to channel it into my writing and my drawing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but
then I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade
hardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.</p>
<p>About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel
whole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my
writing, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell
that new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.</p>
<hr>
<p>“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has
admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of
his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized
he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type
as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his
own.</p>

<p>The writer David Sedaris is a born tidier. He tells childhood stories about
vacuuming and cleaning up after his siblings. When he sold his first book, he
was cleaning houses in Manhattan. Now he’s a rich bestselling author and lives
in a village west of London. Do you know how he spends most of his day? Picking
up trash on the side of the road.</p>
<p>That’s right: One of our most popular living authors estimates that he a garbage
truck after him: “Pig Pen Sedaris.” He’s best known to his neighbors as a litter
picker. When the West Sussex County Times wrote about him, they didn’t even
mention he was a writer.</p>

miracle.”</p>

One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be
determined to make them otherwise.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>

<p>The artist’s natural state is one of not-knowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Donald Barthelme</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths
and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the
books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And
that means the old books . . . To be sure, the books of the future would be
just as good a corrective as the books of the past, but unfortunately we
cannot get at them.”</p>

<h1>Quote</h1>
<ul>
<li>Just because something makes us feel bad doesn’t mean we are bad.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Demons and Shame?
<ul>
<li>Find it. Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark
ugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all
the awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part
of you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,
rather than against it.</li>

<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>
<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get
stronger and healthier and happier.</li>
<li>Goal vs Habits
<ul>
<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X
amount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>
<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one’s efforts
for a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest
them in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>
<li>People don’t develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is
different.</li>
<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,
make other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.
<ul>
<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some
form of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone
to quit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You wouldn’t keep watching a TV show you don’t like. You wouldn’t eat an
entire plate of food you don’t like. So why the hell are you trying to read a
book you don’t like?</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stores</h1>
<ul>
<li>Waight Loss
<ul>
<li>I know someone who lost a lot of weight (almost 80 lbs) over a 2-year
period. He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know
how he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he
could do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout
as he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>
<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a
few more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could
run competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>
<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”
He instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise
bike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too
overwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making Friends
<ul>
<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey
man, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed
by a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off
with a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for
good measure.</li>
<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it
was to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base
with some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>
<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know
someone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting
somebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Give and Take</h1>
<p>Author: Adam Grant Created time: March 13, 2021 6:21 AM Page No.: 384 Progress:
⭕</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>Giver Vs Taker</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses.
<ul>
<li>Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways
to knock them down a notch.</li>
<li>Takers tend to be <strong>self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person
singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me —versus first-person plural
pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21
percent of CEOs’ first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme
takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of
every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four
were about themselves alone and no one else.</li>
<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in
their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt
entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>
<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms
<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total
shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger
losses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung
for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and
larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.
Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put
their companies in jeopardy.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97">Giver and Taker</a> On the left
side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about
me. A big photo is self-glorifying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than
gunning for them.
<ul>
<li>Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success
of people around them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse
skills, and power.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to
knowledge, expertise, and influence.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of
dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a
favor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they
get what they want. <strong>This faker style of networking</strong> casts the entire
enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make
connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.</li>
<li>When <strong>people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational
information</strong>. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form
of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker
tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as
<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning
bridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Storys</h1>
<hr>
<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored
with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his
computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech
server. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the
music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band
skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lekking</strong> - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their
established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court
female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even
do acrobatics.</li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Anything You Want</h1>
<p>Author: Derek Sivers
Created time: March 21, 2021 12:38 AM
Page No.: 96
Progress: ✔️</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start teaching someone something and that you business starts.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Clients of Your Business
<ul>
<li>The Problem with big clients like Google, Microsoft &amp; Apple.
<ul>
<li>You have to custom-tailor your product to please a very few specific people.</li>
<li>Those people might change their minds or leave the company.</li>
<li>Whom are you really working for? Are you self-employed or is this client your boss?</li>
<li>If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.</li>
<li>By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose wants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good thing about small clients.
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to change what you do to please one client; you need to please only the majority (or yourself).</li>
<li>If one client needs to leave, it’s OK; you can sincerely wish her well.</li>
<li>Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).</li>
<li>You hear hundreds of people’s opinions and stay in touch with what the majority of your clients want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes happy &amp; fulfilling.</li>
<li>When you are at something great you don’t feel something big going to happen.</li>
<li>You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.</li>
<li>Business improvement.
<ul>
<li>Customers satisfaction.
<ul>
<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</li>
<li>Make every decision even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone according to what’s best for your customers.</li>
<li>If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important things to remember.
<ul>
<li>Don’t let other people play with your fear. Like Saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios. Those are just sales tactics.</li>
<li>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</li>
<li>Don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>
<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. <strong>It’s a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.</strong></li>
<li>You don’t need something big to improve the business sometimes it’s little things that’s add up.</li>
<li>People remember you more for the smile that you put on there face then fancy business stuff.</li>
<li>Always prepare for 2x because anytime it can come.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Employed VS Business Owner
<ul>
<li>Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles.</li>
<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solve problems
<ul>
<li>Before trusting someone verify that they can do the job.</li>
<li>Why businesses keep problems around? (Like- Nord VPN)
→A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.</li>
<li>If the company has a problem with your decisions then explain your thought process and philosophy.</li>
<li>If you are an owner of the company you can be anything. And if don’t feel like doing something then give the role to someone who loves doing that role.</li>
<li>Don’t freedom but don’t give too much that they can overturn you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start now. No funding needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal improvement.
<ul>
<li>Don’t follow other people path without making your own path.</li>
<li>Don’t spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them you should want.</li>
<li>If present is worse than past, then move back and restart improving where things are good.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.</li>
<li>Doing work yourself is inefficient but it is what make it so joyful in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derek Sivers philosophies of Business.
<ul>
<li>Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.</li>
<li>Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.</li>
<li>When you make a company, you make a utopia. It’s where you design your perfect world.</li>
<li>Never do anything just for the money.</li>
<li>Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.</li>
<li>Your business plan is moot. You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.</li>
<li>Starting with no money is an advantage. You don’t need money to start helping people.</li>
<li>You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.</li>
<li>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</li>
<li>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>That one silly e-mail, sent out with every order, has been so loved that if you search Google for “private CD Baby jet,” you’ll get almost twenty thousand results. Each one is somebody who got the email and loved it enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers.

<p>We answered our phone within two rings, always 7am to 10pm, seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>

<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 9:01 PM Page No.: 146
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>A philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate,
resourceful, and connected.</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make database of people &amp; and how often I should contact them.</li>
<li>Build some persona for people to look up to.</li>
<li>Never give to I am contacting someone.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>How to use friends database?
<ul>
<li>Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.</li>
<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>
<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>
<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have
their correct info.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Normal World &amp; Business World
<ul>
<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they
don’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a
total loser.</li>
<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,
you’re a loser!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to be cool?
<ul>
<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal
boring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had
the courage.</li>
<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but
it’s considerate and part of your art.</li>
<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only
great at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>
<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them
curious.</li>
<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme
character. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About People
<ul>
<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>
<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a
friend. That’s how things are done</li>
<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that
thing is popular.</li>
<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with
your existing contacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business
<ul>
<li>How beat competitor?
<ul>
<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>
<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>
<li>Play a completely different game.</li>
<li>Be radically opposite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters
<ul>
<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.
Make sure they stick together as a group.</li>
<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not
yourself. Make it fun to join.</li>
<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are
having.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been
done.
<ul>
<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use
Amazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not
be able to imagine that niche without you.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your
attention</li>
<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that
it’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>
<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>
<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,
competition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,
being a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that
you’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate
to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>
<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was
completely ignored.</p>
<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d
received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a
second inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>
<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the
chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it
in a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare
time.</p>
<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the
third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a
conference.</p>
<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing
problem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to
get the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the
publisher.</p>
<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for
permission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they
contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>
<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>
<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>
<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They
love it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,
“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on
music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and
tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”
Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing
their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,
and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious
and overwhelming.</p>

<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>John T. Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would
do a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your
poem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?
It’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and
say, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your
life worth?”</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of
the International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family
were sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate
interest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced
major budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help
people connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said
Hadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day
activities.”</p>
<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>
<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him
set up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,
while performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered
questions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded
music, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his
teeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions
of people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t
normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN
SPACE!”</p>
<hr>
<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided
“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to
direct Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he
was held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to
die,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .
. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m
going to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>
<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the
throat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy
and life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a
permanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination
didn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer
George Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or
four days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in
it, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to
really have that</p>

<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to
treat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either
scribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward
computer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>
<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to
Facebook, and blogging at <a href="http://rogerebert.com/">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped
out posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about
everything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak
’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his
inevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,
and he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with
the world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Personal Values</h1>
<p>Author: Mark Manson Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 50 Progress:
✔️</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<h3>Good values are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Evidence-based</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>That “cause” is often what we refer to as our “purpose” and finding it is one
of the most important endeavors we can take to enhance our health and
well-being. But our purpose should be sought not merely through what feels
good. It must be considered and reasoned. We must accumulate evidence
supporting it.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Constructive</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is money for why what you value is often not as important as why you
value it. If you value martial arts because you enjoy hurting people, then
that’s a bad value. But if you value it because you are in the military and
want to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.Controllable</p>
<ul>
<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.
Creativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because
you CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a
side effect.</li>
<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,
standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>
<h3>Bad values are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Emotion-based</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions
and are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge
or information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are
generally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term
gains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Destructive</li>
<li>Uncontrollable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up
your life to that thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,
feeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being
alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,
sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>
<h3>How to change values?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into
valuing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite
effect—they double down).</li>
<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes
this contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.
Too much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>
<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The world sucks</li>
<li>We suck</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of
trying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a
few. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving
your best effort.</li>
<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always
need more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will
need more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need
less money.</li>
<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control
whether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You
can always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always
control if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something
you find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>
<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings
or even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>
<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every
aspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with
your father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for
respect.
<ul>
<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>
<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.
<ul>
<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an
adult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>
<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,
because to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you
are obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fault</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to
make them perfect too.</li>
<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>
<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter
whose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big
hole, start climbing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>
<h3>FAIL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad
long-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.
<ul>
<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not
doing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where
pursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is
intrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>
<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who
don’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life
plans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up
a mountain for a molehill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right
reasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to
never love at all.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Your First Year in Code</h1>
<p>Author: Isaac Lyman Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 184 Progress:
✔️</p>
<ol>
<li>Code is more about People then line.</li>
<li>Bad Tools can waste your time sometimes.</li>
<li>Don’t be religious about your tools it is just a tool not a human even a
living thing.</li>
<li>Nobody cars about your code</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can use whatever coding language or framework you want it is just a line
of code that can change by anybody. It is doesn’t matter that much.</li>
<li>It’s all about the product. The user cares about what you’ve built and how it
solves their problem, not so much about how you got there.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of
development.</li>
<li>If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally
belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you’re aware of
that possibility.</li>
<li>Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.</li>
<li>Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks
have conventions for how things are organized.</li>
<li>Consistent code style. It doesn’t matter what styles you choose.</li>
<li>start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an “About Me” web page, a
metric unit converter.</li>
<li>Burned out</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.</li>
<li>You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or
long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay</li>
<li>Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.</li>
<li>Keep your personal life separate from your work life.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Be the change you wish to see in our industry.</li>
<li>What I call myself</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower
than Junior Software Developer.</li>
<li>The programmer is a term that’s gone the way of the dinosaur.</li>
<li>The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If
your job involves building condominiums, you’re reading the wrong book.</li>
<li>Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the
highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally
I’ve heard it defined in contradictory ways.</li>
<li>JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good
name.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and
operations people.</li>
<li>The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny
operating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely
portable.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand something, Google it. If you can’t figure it out
easily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.</li>
<li>If someone has told you otherwise, you’re in the wrong company. Automate as
much as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far
more time-consuming.</li>
<li>Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need
to keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce
these expenses dramatically.</li>
<li>Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements
change or a solution already exists.</li>
<li>Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.</li>
<li>Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the “best way” to do
something.</li>
<li>The three virtues.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall
energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people
will find useful and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so
many questions about it.</li>
<li>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you
write programs that don’t just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate
them. Or at least pretend to.</li>
<li>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other
people won’t want to say bad things about.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<ol>
<li>When you’re first reading about something new in code.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why is this important or useful?</li>
<li>How does it fit with other topics or technologies?</li>
<li>What’s the problem that it’s trying to solve?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<p>Author: David Epstein
Created time: March 13, 2021 6:02 AM
Page No.: 354
Progress: ✔️</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts.</li>
<li>They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities.</li>
<li>They learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.</li>
<li>The more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example.</li>
<li>Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Learn with Mix things</strong> not a Single thing.</li>
<li>The more likely an expert was to have his or her predictions featured on op-ed pages and television, <strong>the more likely they were always wrong.</strong></li>
<li>The best forecasters view their own ideas as <strong>hypotheses in need of testing.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, <strong>but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crew leadership not as decision making, but as sensemaking.
<ul>
<li>If I make a decision, it is a possession, I take pride in it, I tend to defend it and not listen to those who question it.</li>
<li>If I make sense, then this is more dynamic and I listen and I can change it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Storys</h1>
<p>Dark horses were on the hunt for match quality. “They never look around and say, ‘Oh, I’m going to fall behind, these people started earlier and have more than me at a younger age,’”</p>
<p>Ogas told me.</p>
<p>“They focused on, ‘Here’s who I am at the moment, here are my motivations, here’s what I’ve found I like to do, here’s what I’d like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which of these is the best match right now? And maybe a year from now I’ll switch because I’ll find something better.’”</p>

<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Education
<ul>
<li>More than 80 percent of the world was unschooled; by 1900.</li>
<li>83 percent of the world is literate.</li>
<li>Middle Eastern and North African countries, more than three-quarters of the
people over sixty-five are illiterate, whereas the rate for those in their
teens and twenties is in the single digits.</li>
<li>According to current projections, by the middle of this century, only five
countries will have more than a fifth of their population uneducated, and by
the end of the century the worldwide proportion will fall to zero.</li>
<li>Less-educated people reported having more leisure.</li>
<li>Early in the 19th century, 12 percent of the world could read and write;
today 83 percent can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Politics
<ul>
<li>Engagement with politics is like sports fandom in another way: people seek
and consume news to enhance the fan experience, not to make their opinions
more accurate.</li>
<li>Liberals are more hostile and aggressive.</li>
<li>Conservatives are indeed more prejudiced against African Americans, but
liberals turn out to be more prejudiced against religious Christians.</li>
<li>Conservatives are indeed more biased toward allowing Christian prayers in
schools, but liberals are more biased toward allowing Muslim prayers in
schools.</li>
<li>But just when we need this disinterested forum the most, academia has become
more politicized as well—not more polarized, but more left-wing. Colleges
have always been more liberal than the American population.</li>
<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces
(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and
manpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic
happens, and it fails to make the news.</li>
<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared
with only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but
without data, you would never know it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement of world
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more
fortunate countries to 81.</li>
<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>
<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most
liberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking
countries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist
countries of central Europe.</li>
<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the
idea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over
time.</li>
<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th
century, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car
accident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99
percent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall
to their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less
likely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent
less likely to be killed on the job.</li>
<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human
life. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward
more mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life
virtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and
they constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that
this tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the
stagnation of progress.</li>
<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have
values today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement in Lifestyle
<ul>
<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in
2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the
washing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the
Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children
than stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>
<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty
rate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10
percent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>
<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier
than their helicoptering parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human nature
<ul>
<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those
with meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>
<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones
makes it more meaningful.</li>
<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,
struggle, and worry.</li>
<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are
opened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely
human cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past
and stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of
acquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability
to persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and
efficacy.</li>
<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to
think it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and
helplessness.</li>
<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor
plummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out
of desperation rather than greed.</li>
<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>
<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an
effective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biases
<ul>
<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,
to discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>
<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with
the consequences of their opinions.</li>
<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when
they are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are
after the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>
<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as
much as is feasible.</li>
<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like
it if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the
other—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective
merits.</li>
<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their
beliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you
than to pay attention to those who agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media
<ul>
<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,
feel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>
<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and
they empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their
successes.</li>
<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely
to want a large number of friend.</li>
<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the
1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,
have become any less social.</li>
<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,
unions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal
gatherings and via digital media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tech
<ul>
<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed
to weaponize it.</li>
<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work
to defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>
<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into
preventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of
years of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of
biology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries
<ul>
<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and
regulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western
Europe) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to
live, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human
flourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,
and happiness.</li>
<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries
have gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get
happier still.</li>
<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in
liberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market
freedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>
<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but
what about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in
boring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without
violence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the
former Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cyber Attack
<ul>
<li>The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking
confidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016
American election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a
botnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.</li>
<li>Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weapon
<ul>
<li>The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the
world’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make
lousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,
and citizens of the side that uses them.</li>
<li>The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works
against the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.</li>
<li>Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold
virus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can
shake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy
and kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body
to body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for
cholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish
flu).</li>
<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States
can launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber
aircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a
first strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forecasters
<ul>
<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or
right-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but
misguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event
was to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned
out to be.</li>
<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they
could. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their
speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on
the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not
certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more
readily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>
<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to
experience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for
cognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative
complexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>
<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are
neither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their
abilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as
“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>
<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and
confirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Religions
<ul>
<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are
education, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other
social services.</li>
<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no
religion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or
poverty on the scales.</li>
<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than
stay-at-homes, but</li>
<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is
as charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer
who prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>
<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced
atheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be
fanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of
atheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far
in the 21st.</li>
<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as
“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”
down from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>
<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other
factors constant.</li>
<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,
they stop believing in miracles.</li>
<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>
<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,
the more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who care about you?
<ul>
<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is
meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>
<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws
of the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>
<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan
your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>
<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense
of feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across
billions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is
cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a
responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in
which we all can flourish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Others
<ul>
<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been
lowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>
<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>
<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the
things that happen in the world is that people solve the problems
confronting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><em>Wordsmithing</em> - The making of changes to a text to improve clarity and style.</p>
<p><em>Catastrophize</em> - Worse then it truly is</p>

<p><em>Emphatic</em> - Forcefully and Clearly</p>
<p><em>Millennials</em> - Those born after 1980</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the
liberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed
it—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong
more often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased
crime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal
numerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our
civilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to
Christian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,
“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this
nation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the
face of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars
was spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge
that was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your
mother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet. Um .
. . Could you install it for us?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Spain was an economic laggard among Western countries, even though Spaniards
were highly schooled, because Spanish education was controlled by the Catholic
Church, and “the children of the masses received only oral instruction in the
Creed, the catechism, and a few simple manual skills. . . . Science,
mathematics, political economy, and secular history were considered too
controversial for anyone but trained theologians.”</p>

<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words.</li>
<li>We all have twice as many female ancestors as male (imagine that all the women who have ever lived have averaged one child. Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>
<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>
<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>
<li>About ourselves
<ul>
<li>Order &amp; Chaos
<ul>
<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>
<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>
<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rules
<ul>
<li>We are rule generators. Humans can’t live without rules.</li>
<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hierarchy of value
<ul>
<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>
<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emotions
<ul>
<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>
<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Women
<ul>
<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>
<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>
<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideologies
<ul>
<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>
<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>
<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meaning
<ul>
<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>
<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why we are not equal?
<ul>
<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>
<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>
<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>
<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why you compare yourself?
<ul>
<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>
<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>
<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>
<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>
<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who are you?
<ul>
<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>
<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>
<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>
<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>
<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>
<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>
<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>
<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>
<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What not to do?
<ul>
<li>Low self-worth people
<ul>
<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>
<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>
<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>
<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How internal critic puts you down?
<ul>
<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>
<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>
<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>
<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequence of remaining silent.
<ul>
<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>
<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>
<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What people do that they don’t think they do?
<ul>
<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>
<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>
<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manipulate the World
<ul>
<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>
<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>
<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>
<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to stop doing?
<ul>
<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>
<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>
<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>
<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>
<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>
<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Children
<ul>
<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>
<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About lies
<ul>
<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>
<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>
<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>
<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>
<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to
<ul>
<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>
<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>
<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women
<ul>
<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>
<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>
<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>
<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>
<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>
<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>
<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>
<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?
<ul>
<li>About Truth
<ul>
<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>
<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>
<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>
<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>
<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>
<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>
<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>
<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Self
<ul>
<li>Why to take care of yourself?
<ul>
<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>
<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>
<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>
<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>
<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to improve yourself.
<ul>
<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>
<li>Speak your mind.</li>
<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>
<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>
<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>
<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Improvement Steps
<ul>
<li>Start with yourself.</li>
<li>Take care with yourself.</li>
<li>Define who you are.</li>
<li>Refine your personality.</li>
<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>
<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to know yourself?
<ul>
<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>
<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>
<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?
<ul>
<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>
<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>
<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>
<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why life is a game?
<ul>
<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>
<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>
<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>
<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>
<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to win?
<ul>
<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>
<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>
<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture
<ul>
<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>
<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To improve your life aim small.
<ul>
<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>
<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>
<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>
<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?
<ul>
<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>
<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>
<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>
<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>
<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>
<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?
<ul>
<li>Tell the truth.</li>
<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listening to other people
<ul>
<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>
<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>
<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>
<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>
<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>
<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>
<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>
<li>Don’t blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>
<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>
<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>
<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>
<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>
<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>
<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>
<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship
<ul>
<li>Why we save people?
<ul>
<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>
<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>
<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>
<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why not help some people?
<ul>
<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>
<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>
<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?
<ul>
<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>
<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>
<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bad Friends
<ul>
<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>
<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>
<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>
<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>
<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>
<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Friends
<ul>
<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>
<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>
<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>
<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>
<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>
<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>
<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>
<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>
<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you. You need to give love before you re</strong>ce<strong>ive it.</strong></li>
<li>When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Culture
<ul>
<li>You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion.</li>
<li>You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.</li>
<li>The crowd is by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world and with the people you disagree with.</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> - Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>
<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>
<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>
<hr>
<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>
<hr>
<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>
<hr>
<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Self-Discipline</h1>
<p>Author: Mark Manson Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 50 Progress:
✔️</p>
<h1>Quote</h1>
<ul>
<li>Just because something makes us feel bad doesn’t mean we are bad.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Demons and Shame?
<ul>
<li>Find it. Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark
ugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all
the awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part
of you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,
rather than against it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>
<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get
stronger and healthier and happier.</li>
<li>Goal vs Habits
<ul>
<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X
amount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>
<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one’s efforts
for a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest
them in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>
<li>People don’t develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is
different.</li>
<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,
make other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.
<ul>
<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some
form of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone
to quit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You wouldn’t keep watching a TV show you don’t like. You wouldn’t eat an
entire plate of food you don’t like. So why the hell are you trying to read a
book you don’t like?</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stores</h1>
<ul>
<li>Waight Loss
<ul>
<li>I know someone who lost a lot of weight (almost 80 lbs) over a 2-year
period. He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know
how he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he
could do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout
as he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>
<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a
few more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could
run competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>
<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”
He instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise
bike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too
overwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making Friends
<ul>
<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey
man, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed
by a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off
with a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for
good measure.</li>
<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it
was to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base
with some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>
<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know
someone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting
somebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>
</ul>
</li>

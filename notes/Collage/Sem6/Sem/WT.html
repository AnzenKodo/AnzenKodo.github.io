<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240519101909.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)</strong> played a crucial role in enhancing the security of wireless networks by addressing the vulnerabilities present in its predecessor, <strong>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</strong>.</p>

<p>WPA introduced dynamic encryption keys, making it significantly more challenging for attackers to decipher intercepted data.</p>

<p><strong>Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)</strong> emerged as the successor to WPA, building upon its foundations and introducing stronger encryption and enhanced security mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Features of WPA2</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong>¬†

<ol>
<li>WPA2 employs the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption, offering a higher level of security compared to its predecessors.</li>
<li>AES is known for its strength and efficiency, operating on data blocks and supporting key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong>¬†WPA2 ensures that only authorized devices can connect to the network by employing robust authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of devices attempting to access the Wi-Fi network.</li>
<li><strong>Key Management:</strong>¬†WPA2 manages the distribution and periodic rotation of encryption keys, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Personal and Enterprise Modes:</strong>¬†

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../UT2/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240418040943.png" alt="" /></li>
<li><strong>Personal mode:</strong> is suitable for home networks,</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise mode:</strong> offers additional security features for business and organizational networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Password Protection:</strong>¬†WPA2 requires users to enter a secure passphrase or password to access the Wi-Fi network.</li>
<li><strong>Network Compatibility:</strong>¬†WPA2 is backward compatible with devices supporting older security protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Updates:</strong>¬†WPA2 is periodically updated to address emerging vulnerabilities, ensuring that the wireless environment remains secure in the face of evolving cyber threats.</li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240519112836.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Service Set (ESS):</strong> An ESS is a WLAN consisting of multiple Basic Service Sets (BSS) interconnected by a distribution system (DS), typically a wired network like Ethernet.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed System (DS):</strong> A DS interconnects multiple BSSes within an ESS, forming a larger wireless network.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Service Set (BSS):</strong>

<ul>
<li>It consists of a wireless access point (AP) and its associated stations (STAs) which are usually wireless devices like laptops and smartphones.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240519113524.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Access Point (AP):</strong> It acts as a central hub through which wireless devices can communicate with each other or with wired networks like the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Station (STA):</strong> An STA is a device on a WLAN that communicates with an AP.</li>
<li><strong>Portal:</strong>¬†Serves as a gateway to other networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>**Power management in IEEE802.11 Iinfrastructure Network:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Power Saving Modes (PSM):</strong>

<ul>
<li>IEEE 802.11 defines various Power Saving Modes (PSM) that allow stations to conserve power by entering sleep states when not actively transmitting or receiving data.

<ul>
<li><strong>Doze Mode (PSM):</strong> In Doze Mode, the station's CPU sleeps while the radio wakes up periodically to check for beacons or traffic directed to the station.</li>
<li><strong>Idle Mode (PSM):</strong> The radio is completely turned off in Idle Mode. The station wakes up periodically to listen for beacons from the access point.</li>
<li><strong>Light Sleep Mode (PSM):</strong> The radio remains in a low-power state in Light Sleep Mode. It wakes up upon receiving beacons or packets addressed to the station.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Automatic Power Saving Delivery (APSD):</strong>

<ul>
<li>Automatic Power Saving Delivery (APSD) is a mechanism that allows the access point to buffer data for stations in power-saving mod.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Transmit Power Control (DTPC):</strong>

<ul>
<li>A feature that adjusts the transmission power of Wi-Fi signals based on the distance between the station and the access point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Antenna Diversity:</strong>

<ul>
<li>While not directly related to power saving, antenna diversity can improve signal strength between the station and AP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong>

<ul>
<li>Quality of Service (QoS) is a feature within IEEE 802.11e that prioritizes traffic for delay-sensitive applications like voice or video calls.</li>

<p>Massive MIMO, short for Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output, is a cutting-edge wireless communication technology that involves using a large number of antennas at the base station to serve a significantly smaller number of user terminals.</p>

<p>In a massive MIMO system, the number of antennas at the base station far exceeds the number of antennas typically found in traditional MIMO systems.</p>

<p>By utilizing a large number of antennas, massive MIMO systems can provide better coverage, increased capacity, and enhanced reliability in wireless communication networks.</p>

<p><strong>Types of MIMO: Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO) &amp; Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)</strong></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/GSM-1024x536.webp" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>GSM security is based on the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card and the Authentication Center (AuC) in the network.</li>
<li>The SIM contains the subscriber's secret key Ki, which is shared with the AuC.</li>
<li>Authentication is performed using the COMP128 algorithm, which generates a response value RES and a ciphering key Kc from Ki and a random challenge RAND.</li>
<li>Traffic is encrypted only on the radio interface between the mobile station and the base station using the A5 algorithm.</li>
<li>GSM security has some weaknesses, such as optional authentication, lack of mutual authentication, and vulnerability to replay attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>UMTS security is based on the USIM (Universal SIM) card and the Authentication Center (AuC) in the network.</li>
<li>The USIM and the network authenticate each other, preventing an attacker from faking the home network.</li>
<li>The authentication mechanism prevents replay attacks by introducing a new authentication sequence number SQN.</li>
<li>The key generation algorithms produce a response value RES, an encryption key CK, and an integrity key IK.</li>
<li>Signaling messages exchanged over the radio interface must be marked with a hash derived from the message and the integrity key to prevent tampering.</li>
<li>UMTS security can also be used over GSM networks by replacing the SIM with a USIM.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The main differences in security between UMTS and GSM are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>UMTS provides mutual authentication between the USIM and the network, while GSM only authenticates the subscriber.</li>
<li>UMTS uses stronger encryption algorithms and extends encryption from the radio interface to the Node-B to RNC connection.</li>
<li>UMTS has additional security features such as protection against false base stations and mechanisms for upgrading security features.</li>

<p><strong>Digital Modulation Techniques:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ASK is a digital modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to represent digital data.</li>
<li>It involves switching the amplitude of the carrier between two levels to encode binary data.</li>
<li>ASK is simple to implement but is susceptible to noise and interference.
<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Frequency Shift Keying (FSK):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>FSK is a modulation scheme where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied to represent digital data.</li>
<li>It involves switching the frequency of the carrier between two or more discrete values to encode binary data.</li>

<li><strong>Edge (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Edge, also known as 2.75G, is a digital mobile phone technology that enhances data transmission rates as an extension of GSM.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Edge offers higher bit rates per radio channel, resulting in a threefold increase in capacity and performance compared to ordinary GSM/GPRS connections.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: It delivers higher data rates, making it suitable for packet-switched applications like internet connections.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Edge is a superset to GPRS and can function on any network with GPRS deployed, requiring no hardware or software changes in GSM core networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: GPRS is a packet-based service for data transmission in GSM networks, providing a permanent connection to devices.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: GPRS allows for data transmission rates of up to 20-40 Kbps, making it suitable for early mobile websites.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: It is packet-oriented, converting data into individual packets for transmission and reassembly at the receiver.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong>: GPRS billing is based on the quantity of data transferred rather than connection time, offering more flexibility in data usage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: UMTS is a 3G standard that follows GSM, offering higher data rates and supporting simultaneous voice and data services.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: UMTS delivers symmetric data rates of up to 384 Kbps for handsets, significantly higher than 2G technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: It uses new spectrum at 2GHz, enabling a greater number of digital voice calls and supporting dual-transfer mode for voice and data services.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: UMTS represents a generational leap in mobile communication, providing operators with increased capacity and improved service offerings.</li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240520032629.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The principle of cellular communication relies on the concept of frequency reuse, which allows for efficient utilization of the available spectrum and increased system capacity. Here's an explanation of the key aspects:</p>

<p><strong>Frequency Reuse Concept</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Frequency reuse implies that in a given coverage area, there are several cells that use the same set of frequencies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cluster Size and System Capacity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The number of cells in a cluster is denoted by N, which can only have values that satisfy the equation N = i^2 + ij + j^2, where i and j are integers</li>
<li>Reducing the cluster size N while keeping the cell size constant increases the number of clusters required to cover the given area, resulting in higher capacity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Co-channel Interference and Signal Quality</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Co-channel interference is caused by the cells that reuse the same frequency set</li>
<li>To reduce co-channel interference, co-channel cells must be physically separated by a minimum distance to provide sufficient isolation due to propagation</li>
</ul>

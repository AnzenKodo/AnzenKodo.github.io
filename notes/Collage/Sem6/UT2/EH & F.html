<p>Symptoms of Mobile Hacking:
<img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240416023157.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mobile hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and even entire mobile networks.</p>

<p>These activities can be motivated by various reasons, including financial gain, protest, information gathering (spying), and the thrill of the challenge<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/hacker">1</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-security">2</a>.¬†</p>

<p>Mobile hacking can take many forms, such as phishing, malware attacks, ransomware, cryptojacking, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-security">2</a>.</p>

<p>Types of Mobile Hacking:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Phishing</strong>: Fraudsters send emails or SMS messages designed to steal users‚Äô credentials or sensitive data, such as credit card numbers<a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-hacking">1</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Malware attacks</strong>: Mobile malware is undetected software, such as a malicious app or spyware, created to damage, disrupt or gain illegitimate access to a  device<a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/mobile-malware/">2</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ransomware</strong>: A form of malware that threatens to destroy or withhold a victim‚Äôs data or files.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptojacking</strong>: A form of malware that uses an organization‚Äôs computing power or individual‚Äôs computer power without their knowledge to mine cryptocurrencies, decreasing a device‚Äôs processing abilities and effectiveness<a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/mobile-malware/">2</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks</strong>: These attacks typically require an employee to be connected to an untrusted or compromised network, such as public Wi-Fi or cellular networks. However, the majority of organizations lack policies prohibiting the use of these networks.</li>
<li><strong>Jailbreaking and rooting</strong>: These attacks take advantage of vulnerabilities in the mobile OSs to achieve root access on these devices, enabling an attacker to gain access to more data and cause more damage than with the limited permissions of a standard user<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/how-to-stop-phone-hacking">4</a>.</li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020231025235853.png" alt="IDS Diagram" /></p>

<p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts when such activity is discovered.</p>

<p>IDSs can be classified into two main types:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240416035941.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Network-based IDSs</strong> are installed at the perimeter of the network and monitor traffic on LAN, subnets, or important servers.</li>
<li><strong>Host-based IDSs</strong> are installed on individual host machines and monitor traffic on that specific machin</li>
</ul>

<p>IDSs can use two main detection methods:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="../../Sem5/assets/Pasted%20image%2020231026003108.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Signature-based IDSs</strong> detect attacks based on already known malicious instruction sequences used by malware.</li>
<li><strong>Anomaly-based IDSs</strong> were introduced to detect unknown malware attacks, as new malware is developed rapidly.

<ul>
<li>Machine learning-based methods have a better generalized property compared to signature-based IDSs, as these models can detect a wider range of attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits of IDS:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Detecting intrusions</strong>: IDS monitors network traffic for signs of unauthorized access, misuse, or compromise, detecting potential threats in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Generating alerts</strong>: IDS sends alerts to system administrators or security personnel when it detects suspicious or malicious activity, allowing them to take prompt action to mitigate risks.</li>
<li><strong>Insights into network traffic</strong>: IDS provides valuable insights into network traffic, helping organizations identify any weaknesses and improve network security.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring network activity and generating reports</strong>: IDS helps organizations meet compliance requirements by monitoring network activity and generating reports, providing greater visibility across the network.</li>
<li><strong>Improve network performance</strong> by providing insights into network traffic and identifying any weaknesses that can be addressed to improve security</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Physical acquisition</strong>¬†is done by creating bit-by-bit copies of the physical storage.

<ul>
<li>It helps in extracting the deleted data along with the other content present on the phone.</li>
<li>Following are the two methods of hardware-based data acquisition:¬†

<ul>
<li><strong>JTAG,</strong>¬†Joint Test Action Group is a physical data acquisition method that connects to TAPs (Standard test access ports) on a device to transfer the raw data to the connected hardware directly from the memory chips.¬†</li>
<li><strong>CHIPOff,</strong>¬†this is not a recommended procedure since it can result in damaged chips.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Manual Acquisition</strong>: This method involves visually accessing data on a functional mobile device through its graphical user interface, allowing investigators to view user-accessible data like pictures, documents, call records, and other content.</li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240420041533.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is a Sub-branch of digital forensic. It is related to monitoring, capture, storing and analysis of network activities to discover the source of security attack.</p>

<p>Network monitoring can take many forms, depending on what needs to be examined. As network architectures become more software-centric and decentralized from a hybrid and multi-cloud perspective.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Availability monitoring</strong>

<ul>
<li>Availability monitoring is the simplest way for network teams to know if a device is up and operational.</li>
<li>Protocols that monitor network availability include the following:

<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).</strong>¬†An ICMP ping is a simple verification test that shows whether a device is accessible on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).</strong>¬†SNMP monitors device and interface status.</li>
<li><strong>Event logs (</strong><strong>syslog).</strong>¬†<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/syslog">Syslog</a>¬†collection servers can trigger alerts when uplinks, interfaces or routes become unavailable.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Linux analysis in computer forensics involves the use of various Linux tools and distributions for imaging, data recovery, and analysis of disks and drives. The process typically consists of five major steps: identification, data acquisition, data recovery, analysis, and reporting.</p>

<p>Various shell commands, methods to collect volatile data, the different log files and the information they provide:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>dmesg:</strong> displays the kernel ring buffers, which contains the information about the drivers loaded into kernel.</li>
<li><strong>fsck:</strong> Is meant for File System Consistency Check. It is a tool to check the consistency of Linux file system and repair.</li>
<li><strong>Stat:</strong> Displays file or file system status.</li>
<li><strong>history:</strong> The command history checks and lists the Bash shell commands used. This command helps the users for auditing purposes.</li>
<li><strong>mount:</strong> The command mount causes mounting of a file system or a device to the directory structure, making it accessible by the system.</li>
</ul>

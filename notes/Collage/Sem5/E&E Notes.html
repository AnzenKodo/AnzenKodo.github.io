<p><img src="../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231128064441.png" alt=""></p>

<ol>
<li>Entrepreneurship promotes capital formation by mobilizing the idle saving of the public.</li>
<li>It provides immediate large-scale employment. Thus, it helps reduce the unemployment problem in the country, i.e., the root of all socio-economic problems.</li>
<li>It promotes balanced regional development.</li>
<li>It helps reduce the concentration of economic power.</li>
<li>It stimulates the equitable redistribution of wealth, income and even political power in the interest of the country.</li>
<li>It encourages effective resource mobilization</li>
<li>of capital and skill which might otherwise remain unutilized and idle.</li>
<li>It also induces backward and forward linkages which stimulate the process of economic development in the country.</li>
<li>Last but no means the least, it also promotes country’s export trade i.e., an important ingredient to economic development. Thus, it is clear that entrepreneurship serves as a catalyst of economic development.
On the whole, the role of entrepreneurship in economic development of a country can best be put as “an economy is the effect for which entrepreneurship is the cause”.</li>

<p><img src="assets/78805a221a988e79ef3f42d7c5bfd418-7-700x709.webp" alt="Supply chain management"></p>

<p>SRM is a discipline of working collaboratively with those suppliers that are vital to the success of your organization, to maximize the potential value of those relationships.</p>

<p>Supplier relationship management (SRM) is the discipline of strategically planning and managing, all interactions with third party organizations that supply goods or services to an organization in order to maximize the value of those interactions.</p>
<h3><a name="component-of-srm" class="heading-anchor" href="#component-of-srm" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Component of SRM</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231128064839.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
<li>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:

<ul>
<li>A formal SRM team or office at the corporate level.</li>
<li>The purpose of such a group is to facilitate and coordinate SRM activities across functions and business units</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GOVERNANCE:

<ul>
<li>The SRM office and supply chain function are typically responsible for defining the SRM governance model, which includes a clear and jointly agreed governance framework in place for some top-tier strategic suppliers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT MODEL:

<ul>
<li>Effective supplier relationship management requires an enterprise-wide analysis of what activities to engage in with each supplier.</li>
<li>The common practice of implementing a “one size fits all” approach to managing suppliers can stretch resources and limit the potential value that can be derived from strategic supplier relationships</li>
</ul></li>
<li>VALUE MEASUREMENT

<ul>
<li>SRM delivers a competitive advantage by harnessing talent and ideas from key supply partners and translates this into product and service offerings for end customers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS:

<ul>
<li>These systems can be used to gather and track supplier performance data across sites, business units or regions.</li>
<li>The benefit is a more comprehensive and objective picture of supplier performance, which can be used to make better sourcing decisions, as well as identify and address systemic supplier performance problems.</li>
</ul></li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-Seed Funding</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This is the earliest stage of financing, where the company is often little more than an idea for a product or service that has the potential to develop into a successful business down the road.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs spend most of this stage convincing investors that their ideas represent a viable investment opportunity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Seed Funding</strong>:

<ul>
<li>At this stage, the startup will have increased costs as the founder incorporates the business and devotes more time.</li>
<li>Seed funding is the first official stage of venture capital financing, and it typically involves raising funds from angel investors or venture capitalists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Series A Funding</strong>

<ul>
<li>This stage of financing is typically used to fund the company's initial growth and expansion.</li>
<li>The company has already launched its product or service and has a proven business model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Series B Funding</strong>

<ul>
<li>This stage of financing is used to fund the company's expansion into new markets or to develop new products.</li>
<li>The company has already established itself in the market and has a growing customer base.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Series C Funding</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This stage of financing is usually the last stage of venture capital financing.</li>
<li>Businesses in this funding stage are doing well and require additional funding to help develop new products, expand into new markets, or even acquire other companies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expansion Stage Financing</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This financing follows first-stage financing and provides working capital for the initial expansion of a business that is producing and shipping product and has growing accounts receivable and inventories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This is the stage where a company goes public and sells shares of its stock to the public for the first time.</li>

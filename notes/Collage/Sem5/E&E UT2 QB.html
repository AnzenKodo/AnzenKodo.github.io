<p><img src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020231027230903.png" alt="Financing stages"></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-Seed Funding</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This is the earliest stage of financing, where the company is often little more than an idea for a product or service that has the potential to develop into a successful business down the road.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs spend most of this stage convincing investors that their ideas represent a viable investment opportunity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Seed Funding</strong>:

<ul>
<li>At this stage, the startup will have increased costs as the founder incorporates the business and devotes more time.</li>
<li>Seed funding is the first official stage of venture capital financing, and it typically involves raising funds from angel investors or venture capitalists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Series A Funding</strong>

<ul>
<li>This stage of financing is typically used to fund the company's initial growth and expansion.</li>
<li>The company has already launched its product or service and has a proven business model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Series B Funding</strong>

<ul>
<li>This stage of financing is used to fund the company's expansion into new markets or to develop new products.</li>
<li>The company has already established itself in the market and has a growing customer base.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Series C Funding</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This stage of financing is usually the last stage of venture capital financing.</li>
<li>Businesses in this funding stage are doing well and require additional funding to help develop new products, expand into new markets, or even acquire other companies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expansion Stage Financing</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This financing follows first-stage financing and provides working capital for the initial expansion of a business that is producing and shipping product and has growing accounts receivable and inventories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This is the stage where a company goes public and sells shares of its stock to the public for the first time.</li>
<li>This stage of financing is typically used to raise a significant amount of capital to fund the company's growth and expansion.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>A venture capitalist expects a company to satisfy three general criteria before he or she will commit to venture.</p>

<p><img src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020231027233804.png" alt="Criteria of Venture Proposal Management"></p>

<ol>

<p><img src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020231027235323.png" alt="Function of venture capital"></p>

<p>Venture capital is a form of private equity that provides funding, technical, or managerial expertise to startups and early-stage emerging companies with little to no operating history but significant potential for growth.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Providing Capital</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Venture capital firms provide funding for new companies in the early stages of development.</li>
<li>This funding is typically used to hire employees, rent facilities, and begin designing a product.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Offering Technical and Managerial Expertise</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Venture capital firms offer technical and managerial expertise to startups.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Assessing Investment Opportunities</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Venture capitalists use specific criteria to evaluate new venture proposals and decide whether to invest in them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Growing Portfolio Companies</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Venture capitalists aim to grow their portfolio companies to the point where they become attractive targets for acquisitions or IPOs.</li>
<li>The VC firm's goal is to increase the value of the startup, then profitably exit the investment by either selling the fund's stake or via an initial public offering (IPO).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spurring Innovation</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Venture capital plays a crucial role in spurring innovation by providing funding to new businesses that do not have access to stock markets and do not have enough cash flow to take on debts.</li>
</ul></li>

4. Short note on SWOT Analysis.<a name="4-short-note-on-swot-analysis" class="heading-anchor" href="#4-short-note-on-swot-analysis" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a></h2>
<p><img src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020231028001504.png" alt="SWOT Analysis Example"></p>

<p>SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.</p>

<p>SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique used to identify and analyze the internal and external factors that can affect a business or project.</p>
<h3>
Components of SWOT Analysis<a name="components-of-swot-analysis" class="heading-anchor" href="#components-of-swot-analysis" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Strengths

<ul>
<li>Strengths describe what an organization excels at and what separates it from the competition: a strong brand, loyal customer base, a strong balance sheet, unique technology, and so on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weaknesses

<ul>
<li>Weaknesses stop an organization from performing at its optimum level.</li>
<li>They are areas where the business needs to improve to remain competitive: a weak brand, higher-than-average turnover, high levels of debt, an inadequate supply chain, or lack of capital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Opportunities

<ul>
<li>Opportunities refer to favorable external factors that could give an organization a competitive advantage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Threats

<ul>
<li>Threats refer to factors that have the potential to harm an organization.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>
How to Do a SWOT Analysis<a name="how-to-do-a-swot-analysis" class="heading-anchor" href="#how-to-do-a-swot-analysis" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Determine Your Objective

<ul>
<li>Objective in mind, a company will have guidance on what they hope to achieve at the end of the process.</li>
<li>Example: The SWOT analysis should help determine whether or not the product should be introduced</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Step 2: Gather Resources

<ul>
<li>A company should begin by understanding what information it has access to, what data limitations it faces, and how reliable its external data sources are.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Step 3: Compile Ideas

<ul>
<li>The group of people assigned to performing the analysis should begin listing ideas within each category.

<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Factors</strong>

<ul>
<li>What occurs within the company serves as a great source of information for the strengths and weaknesses categories of the SWOT analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>External Factors</strong>

<ul>
<li>What happens outside of the company is equally as important to the success of a company as internal factors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Step 4: Refine Findings

<ul>
<li>By refining the thoughts that everyone had, a company can focus on only the best ideas or largest risks to the company.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Step 5: Develop the Strategy

<ul>
<li>Members of the analysis team take the bulleted list of items within each category and create a synthesized plan that provides guidance on the original objective.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Key features of effective supply chain management<a name="key-features-of-effective-supply-chain-management" class="heading-anchor" href="#key-features-of-effective-supply-chain-management" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connected:</strong> Being able to access unstructured data from social media, structured data.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Improving collaboration with suppliers increasingly.</li>
<li><strong>Cyber-aware:</strong> The supply chain must harden its systems and protect them from cyber-intrusions and hacks, which should be an enterprise-wide concern.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitively enabled:</strong> Most of the supply chain is automated and self-learning.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> Analytics capabilities must be scaled with data in real time. Insights will be comprehensive and fast.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Free trade</strong> is a way for countries to exchange goods and resources. This means countries can specialize in producing goods where they have a comparative advantage (this means they can produce goods at a lower opportunity cost).</li>
<li><strong>Free movement of labor</strong> Increased labor migration gives advantages to both workers and recipient countries.</li>
<li><strong>Increased economies of scale</strong> Production is increasingly specialised.</li>
<li><strong>Greater competition</strong> Domestic monopolies used to be protected by a lack of competition. However, globalisation means that firms face greater competition from foreign firms.</li>
<li><strong>Increased investment</strong> Globalisation has also enabled increased levels of investment. It has made it easier for countries to attract short-term and long-term investment.</li>

<h3><a name="what-are-different-security-threats-to-e-business-03-marks" class="heading-anchor" href="#what-are-different-security-threats-to-e-business-03-marks" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>What are different Security Threats to e-business? (03 Marks).</h3>
<p>E-commerce involves online buying and selling. Threats arise from using the internet for theft, fraud, and security breaches. These threats can be accidental, intentional, or due to human error.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Electronic Payment System Risks:</strong> Electronic payment systems are crucial for e-commerce, enabling paperless transactions and reducing costs. However, they pose several risks:

<ul>
<li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Authentication methods like passwords and security questions can be compromised, allowing unauthorized access to funds.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Evasion:</strong> The digital nature of electronic payments can complicate tax compliance verification for revenue services.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Conflicts:</strong> Automated systems handling frequent, large-volume transactions with multiple recipients are prone to errors and technical glitches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>E-cash Threats:</strong> E-cash is an anonymous paperless fund transfer system. While convenient, storing financial information digitally makes it vulnerable to hackers. Major threats include:

<ul>
<li><strong>Backdoor Attacks:</strong> Attackers gain unauthorized system access, bypassing normal authentication and remaining hidden.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attackers disrupt access for legitimate users by overwhelming network resources.</li>
<li><strong>Eavesdropping:</strong> Unauthorized interception of private online communications occurs without detection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Credit/Debit Card Fraud:</strong> Credit cards allow borrowing for purchases, while debit cards use deposited funds. Associated threats include:

<ul>
<li><strong>ATM Skimming:</strong> Devices attached to card readers steal card details (number, name, CVV, expiry).</li>
<li><strong>Vishing/Phishing:</strong> Attackers deceive users via phone calls (vishing) or SMS (smishing) posing as legitimate entities to obtain sensitive information like PINs and account details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="write-short-note-on-digital-certificates-03-marks" class="heading-anchor" href="#write-short-note-on-digital-certificates-03-marks" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Write short note on: Digital Certificates (03 Marks).</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020250419015352.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Digital certificates are electronic credentials that establish the identity of websites, individuals, or organizations involved in online transactions.</p>

<p>Acting as digital passports, they bind a public key to the identity of the certificate holder, verifying their legitimacy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Website Authentication:</strong> Ensuring users are interacting with the genuine website and not a fraudulent imitation.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Communication (Encryption):</strong> Utilizing protocols like SSL/TLS, digital certificates facilitate encrypted communication between the user's browser and the web server, protecting sensitive data like login credentials, payment information, and personal details from eavesdropping. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> For individuals and organizations, digital certificates can be used to create digital signatures, providing authenticity and integrity to electronic documents and transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Types of digital certificates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SSL/TLS Certificates:</strong> Secure communication between a web server and a browser, enabling HTTPS and encrypting data transmitted online.</li>
<li><strong>Code Signing Certificates:</strong> Verify the identity and integrity of software code, assuring users that the software comes from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with.</li>
<li><strong>Email Certificate:</strong> Secure email communication by providing encryption and digital signing of emails, ensuring confidentiality and sender authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Document Signing Certificates:</strong> Allow individuals and organizations to digitally sign electronic documents, providing proof of authorship and ensuring document integrity.</li>
</ul>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020250419015459.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Digital signatures are electronic equivalents of handwritten signatures, providing a way to authenticate the origin and ensure the integrity of digital documents or messages.</p>

<p>Here's how they work:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hashing:</strong> The document or message is processed using a cryptographic hash function, creating a unique and fixed-size &quot;digital fingerprint&quot; or hash value. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The sender's private key is used to encrypt this hash value, creating the digital signature.</li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> The recipient uses the sender's corresponding public key to decrypt the digital signature. If the decryption is successful and the resulting hash value matches the hash value independently computed from the received document, it confirms:

<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The sender is who they claim to be, as only their private key could have created a valid signature verifiable by their public key. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> The document has not been altered since it was signed, as any change would result in a different hash value and the signature verification would fail. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> The sender cannot deny having signed the document, as the private key is unique to them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="write-short-note-on-firewall-as-security-control-02-marks" class="heading-anchor" href="#write-short-note-on-firewall-as-security-control-02-marks" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Write short note on: Firewall as Security Control (02 Marks).</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020250419015524.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>A firewall is a network security system that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. Functioning like a gatekeeper, it monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a predefined set of security rules. ¬†</p>

<p>As a crucial security control, a firewall's primary purpose is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It achieves this by: ¬†</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filtering Traffic:</strong> Examining network packets based on source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Controlling Access:</strong> Defining which applications and services are allowed to communicate across the network boundary. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Preventing Intrusions:</strong> Identifying and blocking potentially malicious traffic, such as attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or initiate denial-of-service attacks. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Logging Activity:</strong> Recording network traffic and security events, providing valuable information for monitoring, analysis, and incident response.</li>

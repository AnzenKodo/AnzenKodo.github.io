<p><strong>Certificate Authority</strong></p>

<p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted third party that issues digital certificates to verify the identity of participants within the Hyperledger Fabric network.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> CAs verify the identities of network members (peers, orderers, clients) before issuing certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Management:</strong> They handle the issuance, renewal, and revocation of digital certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Enrollment:</strong> Participants must enroll with the CA to obtain certificates, proving their identity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric</strong></p>

<p>Chaincode, similar to smart contracts, defines the business logic and rules for a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Business Logic:</strong> Chaincode dictates how ledger data is accessed and modified, automating complex processes.</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> It runs in a secured Docker container, isolated from the endorsing peer process.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable:</strong> Chaincode can be written in Go, Node.js, or Java.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ERC20 Tokens in Blockchain Applications</strong></p>

<p>ERC20 is a technical standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring assets function properly within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> ERC20 tokens ensure compatibility between different assets and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Programmable Money:</strong> They facilitate the development of lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity pools.</li>
<li><strong>Representation of Assets:</strong> ERC20 tokens can represent real-world assets like real estate or artwork on the blockchain, increasing liquidity and fractional ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps to Create an ERC20 Token</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Set Up Your Development Environment</li>
<li>Create a New Hardhat Project:</li>
<li>Install OpenZeppelin</li>
<li>Write the ERC-20 Smart Contract</li>
<li>Configure Hardhat</li>
<li>Compile the Contract</li>
<li>Deploy the Contract</li>
<li>Interact with your token</li>

Explain hard and soft forks with suitable examples. (10 Marks, 10 Marks, 5 Marks) (2024 May, 2023 May, 2023 December)</h2>
<p>A blockchain fork happens when a blockchain splits into two or more separate chains.</p>

<p>This can occur in two main ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accidental Forks</strong>

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250228081332.webp" alt="" /></li>
<li>These are temporary splits, often due to network issues, like when two miners find a block at the same time. The network resolves this by choosing the longest chain, and the other chain is discarded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intentional Forks</strong>

<ul>
<li>These are planned changes to the blockchain‚Äôs rules. There are two types:

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250228082234.webp" alt="" /></li>
<li><strong>Soft Forks</strong>: These are upgrades where the new rules are a subset of the old ones, meaning old nodes can still accept new blocks. An example is Bitcoin‚Äôs Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade, which didn‚Äôt create a new chain.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Forks</strong>: These are changes that aren‚Äôt backward compatible, creating a new chain separate from the old one. This can lead to a new cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin Cash, which split from Bitcoin in 2017 over block size disagreements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Explain the distinct features and drawbacks of a private blockchain. Discuss any two examples of private blockchain. (10 Marks, 10 Marks) (2024 May, 2023 December)</h2>
<p>A private blockchain, also known as a permissioned blockchain, is a blockchain network that requires authorization to participate. Unlike public blockchains, where anyone can join, a private blockchain is controlled by a single organization or a group of known entities. This central authority determines who can access the network, view the data, and participate in the transaction validation process.</p>

<p><strong>Distinct Features of a Private Blockchain:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Permissioned Access:</strong> Only authorized participants can join and interact with the network.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> A single organization or a consortium governs the network and its rules.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Privacy:</strong> Transaction data and network activity can be restricted to authorized participants.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Transaction Speeds:</strong> With a smaller and known set of participants, consensus mechanisms can be more efficient, leading to faster transaction processing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drawbacks of a Private Blockchain:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Centralization:</strong> The centralized nature can be seen as a contradiction to the core principles of blockchain and may lead to a single point of failure or control.</li>
<li><strong>Trust Requirement:</strong> Participants need to trust the central authority or governing entities.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Transparency:</strong> The restricted access can reduce the transparency and immutability benefits typically associated with public blockchains.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Security:</strong> Compared to large, decentralized public blockchains, a private blockchain with fewer nodes might be more vulnerable to attacks if the central authority is compromised.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of Private Blockchain:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Hyperledger Fabric:</strong> An open-source, enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger framework hosted by the Linux Foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Private Ethereum Blockchain</strong>: Unlike the public Ethereum mainnet, a private Ethereum blockchain restricts access to a select group of participants.</li>
<li><strong>R3 Corda:</strong> A permissioned distributed ledger technology designed specifically for businesses, particularly in the financial services industry.</li>

(10 Marks, 5 Marks) (2024 December, 2023 May)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight nodes, also known as Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes, download only block headers, not the entire blockchain.</li>
<li>They rely on full nodes for transaction verification.</li>
<li>Commonly used in mobile wallets and applications with limited storage and bandwidth.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privacy Solutions for SPV Nodes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced Data Exposure:</strong>

<ul>
<li>SPV nodes use Merkle proofs to verify transactions.</li>
<li>They request only block headers and necessary Merkle branches, minimizing downloaded and stored data.</li>
<li>This limited data exposure enhances user privacy by not revealing the entire transaction history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Random Connections:</strong>

<ul>
<li>To prevent attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) or double-spending, SPV nodes connect randomly to different full nodes, increasing the chance of communicating with an honest node.</li>
<li>Connecting to a random set of nodes also reduces the risk of tracking by a single entity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Mitigation:</strong>

<ul>
<li>While vulnerable to attacks like network partitioning or Sybil attacks, SPV nodes mitigate some risks by connecting to multiple nodes for data and using Merkle proofs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tor Network:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Communication between SPV and full nodes can reduce anonymity, causing privacy concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bloom Filters:</strong>

<ul>
<li>SPV nodes can use Bloom filters to request transactions without revealing the exact transactions of interest, providing a layer of privacy.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="./assets/Pasted%20image%2020250510200423.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>A Block in a Blockchain is a fundamental data structure that stores a collection of transactions and metadata, forming a single unit in the blockchain's sequential chain.</p>

<p><strong>Structure of a Block</strong>: A block is a data structure containing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Block Header</strong>: Metadata about the block.

<ul>
<li><strong>Previous Block</strong>: Hash of previous block.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp</strong>: Creation time of block in Unix timestamp format.</li>
<li><strong>Nonce</strong>: A number miners adjust to find a valid hash for PoW.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty Target</strong>: The mining difficulty required for the block‚Äôs Proof of Work (PoW).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transaction Data</strong>: List of transactions included in the block.</li>
<li><strong>Other Data</strong>: Optional fields like block size or version.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Block Header Hash</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>A unique cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the block header.</li>
<li>Acts as the block's identifier.</li>
<li>Ensures integrity; any change in the block alters the hash.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Block Height</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The position of a block in the blockchain, starting from 0 (genesis block).</li>
<li>Example: The 100th block has a block height of 99.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Genesis Block</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first block in a blockchain (block height 0).</li>
<li>Hardcoded into the blockchain protocol.</li>
<li>Has no previous block hash, as it‚Äôs the starting point.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Linking Blocks in the Blockchain</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blocks are linked in a chain via the <strong>previous block hash</strong> in the block header.</li>
<li>Each block references the hash of the previous block, forming a chronological sequence.</li>
<li>Ensures immutability; altering a block breaks the chain, as subsequent hashes mismatch.</li>
</ul>

(10 Marks, 5 Marks) (2024 May, 2023 May)</h2>
<p><strong>Interoperability challenge</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data seamlessly.</li>
<li>However, achieving interoperability is challenging due to the following reasons:

<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of Standardization</strong>: Different blockchain platforms use various protocols, consensus mechanisms, and data formats, making it difficult for them to interact with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Integration</strong>: Integrating blockchain with existing legacy systems requires significant effort and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Ensuring secure data transfer between different blockchain networks is a major concern.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scalability challenge</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Scalability is the ability of a blockchain network to handle a growing amount of transactions and data.</li>
<li>The main challenges related to scalability include:

<ol>
<li><strong>Transaction Throughput</strong>: Traditional blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have limited transaction throughput, leading to slow processing times and high fees during peak periods.</li>
<li><strong>Network Latency</strong>: As the number of nodes in a blockchain network increases, the time required to propagate transactions and blocks across the network also increases, resulting in higher latency.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Consumption</strong>: The consensus mechanisms used in many blockchain networks, such as Proof of Work (PoW), are energy-intensive and not sustainable for large-scale applications.</li>
</ol></li>

<p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which</p>

<ul>
<li>new bitcoins are created and</li>
<li>transactions are added to the blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Miners use computational power to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, and the first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin mining process involves several key steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Validation:</strong> Nodes in the Bitcoin network validate transactions by checking digital signatures, ensuring inputs are unspent, and verifying that they follow protocol rules. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion in Blocks:</strong> Miners include these validated transactions in new blocks. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Proof of Work:</strong> Miners solve a complex Proof of Work puzzle to add the block to the blockchain. ¬†</li>

<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A &quot;number only used once&quot; that miners adjust to find a valid hash for a block in Proof of Work (PoW) systems.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Initially set by network software but modifiable by the miner.</li>
<li>Used to vary the input of the hash function, allowing miners to generate different hashes until the difficulty target is met.</li>
<li>Acts like a salt in hashing; the generated hash must match the difficulty rate format (e.g., <code>000x10xxxx000xxx</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Values:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Can be any integer. Miners increment the nonce and rehash the block header until a valid hash is found.</li>
<li>In Bitcoin, it's a 32-bit integer ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295.</li>

<p>A theoretical problem in distributed systems where¬†<strong>nodes must agree on a unified action</strong>¬†despite:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Malicious actors</strong>¬†(traitors) spreading conflicting information.</li>
<li><strong>Unreliable communication</strong>¬†(messages delayed or lost).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>Imagine generals surrounding a city, needing to coordinate an attack via messengers. Some generals are traitors who send false orders. The loyal generals must agree on a plan despite deception.</p>

<p><strong>Relevance to Blockchain Consensus</strong></p>

<p>Blockchains are decentralized networks where nodes must agree on transaction validity. The BGP highlights the need for¬†<strong>Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)</strong>¬†to ensure consensus even if some nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lie</strong>¬†(e.g., double-spend attacks).</li>
<li><strong>Fail</strong>¬†(e.g., go offline).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How Consensus Mechanisms Solve Byzantine General Problem</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Miners solve cryptographic puzzles to validate blocks.</li>
<li><strong>BFT</strong>: Attackers need &gt;51% of computational power to disrupt consensus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Validators are chosen based on their staked tokens.</li>
<li><strong>BFT</strong>: Malicious validators risk losing their stake (&quot;slashing&quot;).</li>

<li>Bitcoin (BTC)</li>
<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
<li>XRP (XRP)</li>
<li>Dogecoin (DOGE)</li>
<li>Solana (SOL)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Explanation of Two Cryptocurrencies:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Bitcoin is the <strong>first and most well-known cryptocurrency</strong>, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It was designed as a <strong>decentralized digital currency</strong> aiming to be an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, allowing peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Bitcoin operates on its own public, decentralized ledger called the <strong>Bitcoin blockchain</strong>. This blockchain records every Bitcoin transaction in a transparent and immutable manner.</li>
<li><strong>Mining:</strong> New Bitcoins are created through a process called <strong>&quot;mining,&quot;</strong> where powerful computers solve complex cryptographic puzzles.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> and launched in 2015.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is a <strong>decentralized platform</strong> that enables the creation and execution of <strong>smart contracts</strong> and <strong>decentralized applications (dApps)</strong>. It aims to be a <strong>&quot;world computer&quot;</strong> that can run any type of application in a decentralized and trustless manner. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Ethereum operates on its own blockchain, which not only records Ether transactions but also the state of smart contracts and dApps.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.</li>

<li><strong>EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine):</strong> The runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Ether (ETH):</strong> The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, used to pay for transaction fees and computational services.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum Wallets:</strong> Digital tools for storing, managing, and interacting with Ether and ERC-20 tokens.</li>
<li><strong>ERC Tokens:</strong> Tokens created on the Ethereum blockchain that follow specific standards, with ERC-20 being the most common for fungible tokens.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="explain-the-proof-of-stake-10-marks-2024-may" class="heading-anchor" href="#explain-the-proof-of-stake-10-marks-2024-may" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Explain the Proof of Stake (10 Marks) (2024 May)</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250227215625.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism used to verify transactions on a blockchain. Instead of relying on the computational power of miners (as in Proof of Work), PoS selects validators to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they &quot;stake&quot; or lock up.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staking:</strong> Cryptocurrency holders can &quot;stake&quot; their coins, essentially locking them up as collateral.</li>
<li><strong>Validators:</strong> These staked coins give the owners the chance to be chosen as validators.</li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong> The selection process for validators can vary but often prioritizes those with a larger stake. Some systems also consider the &quot;age&quot; of the staked coins.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Chosen validators verify new transactions and create new blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Validators are typically rewarded with transaction fees or newly minted cryptocurrency for their work.</li>

<p><strong>Transactions in Bitcoin</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>:

<ul>
<li>A Bitcoin transaction consists of inputs and outputs.</li>
<li>Inputs are the sources of the bitcoins being spent</li>
<li>outputs are the destinations where the bitcoins are sent</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>:

<ul>
<li>When a user initiates a transaction, it is broadcast to the network, validated by nodes, and included in a block by miners.</li>
<li>Transactions are verified by nodes in the network through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical puzzles (Proof of Work) to add new blocks to the blockchain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Each transaction is secured using cryptographic techniques, including digital signatures and hashing, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the transaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</li>

<p><strong>Distributed Ledger Technology</strong> (DLT) is a way to record and share data across many computers, called nodes, where each node has a full copy of the ledger. It‚Äôs like a shared, digital notebook that everyone in the network can see and agree on, used for things like tracking transactions in cryptocurrencies or supply chains.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralize</strong>: There‚Äôs no central authority; control is shared among all participants, making it harder for one party to manipulate the data.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Copies</strong>: Each node keeps its own version of the ledger, so if one fails, others still have the data, keeping things running smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>Consensus</strong>: Nodes use consensus methods, like voting or solving puzzles, to agree on what‚Äôs true, ensuring everyone sees the same thing.</li>
<li><strong>Locked with Codes</strong>: It uses cryptography, like secret codes, to secure data, so it‚Äôs tough for hackers to change anything without permission.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable</strong>: Once something is written, it‚Äôs hard to alter, like carving in stone, preserving the history of all actions.</li>

<p>When a miner finds a solution to the Proof-of-Work puzzle, they propose a new block to the Bitcoin network. Other nodes then validate this proposed block through the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Syntax and Data Structure Check:</strong> Nodes verify that the block adheres to the correct format and structure defined by the Bitcoin protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Hash Verification:</strong> They confirm that the block's hash meets the difficulty target set by the network. This ensures that the miner has indeed performed the required computational work.</li>
<li><strong>Previous Block Hash Check:</strong> Nodes ensure that the hash of the previous block included in the current block header matches the hash of the last accepted block in their local copy of the blockchain. This maintains the chain's integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp Validation:</strong> They check if the block's timestamp is valid, ensuring it's not too far in the future or past.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Verification:</strong> Each transaction within the block is individually validated to ensure.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase Transaction Check:</strong> Nodes verify that the first transaction in the block is a valid coinbase transaction, which awards the miner the block reward and any transaction fees. They also check that the reward amount is correct according to the current block subsidy.</li>

<p><strong>Difficulty Level in Bitcoin:</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>difficulty level</strong> in Bitcoin is a measure of how hard it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. It essentially quantifies the computational resources required to mine a valid block.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>higher difficulty</strong> means that miners need to perform more hashing operations on average to find a hash that meets the target.</li>
<li>A <strong>lower difficulty</strong> means it's easier to find a valid block.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Calculation of Difficulty Level:</strong></p>

<p>The difficulty level is not directly calculated in terms of a specific Bitcoin amount but is derived from the <strong>target hash</strong>. The target hash is a 256-bit number that the block's hash must be less than or equal to for the block to be considered valid.</p>

<p>The difficulty is calculated using the following formula:</p>

<p>$$Difficulty={\text{Current¬†Target} \over \text{Maximum¬†Target}}$$‚Äã</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum Target:</strong> This is a fixed 256-bit number that represents the easiest possible mining difficulty (difficulty of 1).</li>
<li><strong>Current Target:</strong> This is the target hash for the most recent block. It is a 256-bit number that is adjusted by the Bitcoin network.</li>

<p>Scalability challenge in Hyperledger Blockchain refers to the ability of a blockchain network to handle a growing amount of transactions and data.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Throughput</strong>: Traditional blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have limited transaction throughput, leading to slow processing times and high fees during peak periods. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Network Latency</strong>: As the number of nodes in a blockchain network increases, the time required to propagate transactions and blocks across the network also increases, resulting in higher latency. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Energy Consumption</strong>: The consensus mechanisms used in many blockchain networks, such as Proof of Work (PoW), are energy-intensive and not sustainable for large-scale applications. ¬†
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>To overcome these challenges, several solutions are being explored: ¬†</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Layer 2 Scaling Solutions</strong>: Techniques like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Plasma for Ethereum aim to increase transaction throughput by processing transactions off-chain and only settling them on the main blockchain. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Sharding</strong>: This involves dividing the blockchain into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This can significantly improve scalability. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Improved Consensus Mechanisms</strong>: Transitioning to more efficient consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), can reduce energy consumption and increase transaction throughput. ¬†</li>

<p><strong>Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)</strong></p>

<p>Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) in Ethereum are akin to traditional bank accounts. They are controlled by a private key, giving the owner the ability to initiate transactions.</p>

<p>Key characteristics of EOAs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hold Ether:</strong> EOAs can hold Ether (ETH) and other ERC-20 tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Have a balance:</strong> The amount of Ether held by the EOA is tracked in its account state.</li>
<li><strong>Have a nonce:</strong> A nonce is a counter that tracks the number of transactions sent from the EOA. This prevents replay attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Have a CodeHash:</strong> For EOAs, the CodeHash field is empty or contains a specific hash indicating no associated code.</li>
<li><strong>Have a Storage Root:</strong> For EOAs, the Storage Root represents an empty Merkle tree as they do not store persistent data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contract Addresses</strong></p>

<p>Contract addresses are unique identifiers for smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike EOAs controlled by private keys, contract accounts are governed by their associated code.</p>

<p>Key characteristics of Contract Addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Controlled by code:</strong> The behavior and execution of a smart contract are determined by its deployed code.</li>
<li><strong>Cannot initiate transactions autonomously:</strong> Contracts can only execute code and transfer Ether in response to transactions initiated by EOAs or other contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Hold Ether and store data:</strong> Contracts can hold Ether and maintain persistent data in their own storage.</li>
<li><strong>Have a nonce:</strong> The nonce for a contract account tracks the number of contracts it has created.</li>
<li><strong>Have a CodeHash:</strong> This field contains the cryptographic hash of the contract's bytecode, uniquely identifying its code.</li>
<li><strong>Have a Storage Root:</strong> This represents the root hash of the Merkle-Patricia trie that stores the contract's persistent data.</li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="./assets/Pasted%20image%2020250505093914.webp" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>These are private subnetworks within the Fabric network that allow a specific set of participants to conduct private and confidential transactions.</li>
<li>Provide data isolation and privacy, restricting transaction access to channel participants only.</li>
<li>Each channel maintains its own separate ledger.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Aspects:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data Isolation:</strong> Transactions are visible only to channel participants.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Policies:</strong> Channels can define unique policies for endorsement, ordering, and membership.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Channels:</strong> A single network can support multiple channels, enabling complex multi-party interactions with maintained confidentiality.</li>

<ul>
<li>Uses the equation y2=x3+ax+b to generate public and private keys.</li>
<li>The constant values of a and b change the curve's shape.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Generation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The private key is a randomly selected number or the number of iterations to reach from one base point to the public key.</li>
<li>The public key is a point on the elliptic curve obtained by multiplying the private key with a predefined point on the curve (called the base point):</li>
</ul>

<p>$$ \text{Private Key} \times \text{Base Point} = \text{Public Key} $$</p>

<p><strong>Properties of Elliptic Curves (Relevant to Cryptography)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Symmetric to the x-axis.</li>
<li>A non-vertical line drawn from any point intersects the curve at no more than three points.</li>
<li>Points on the curve can be &quot;added&quot; together to produce another point on the curve.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trapdoor Function in ECC</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Given a private key (k) and a base point (A), it is easy to compute the public key (B) such that B=k‚ãÖA.</li>

<li><p>However, given the public key (B) and the base point (A), it is computationally infeasible to find the private key (k). This is the basis of the trapdoor function in ECC.</p></li>

<li><p>Offers strong security with smaller key sizes compared to other cryptographic systems like RSA.</p>

<ul>
<li>Example: ECC uses a 256-bit key size compared to RSA's 3072-bit key size.</li>
<li>Similarly, ECC uses a 384-bit key size compared to RSA's 7680-bit key size.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>ECC can be used for encryption and decryption, digital signatures, and key exchange.</p></li>

<p>ERC-721 is a <strong>technical standard on the Ethereum blockchain</strong> that defines the interface for <strong>non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong>. ¬†</p>

<p>Key aspects of ERC-721:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Non-Fungible:</strong> Each token is unique and not interchangeable with another. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Unique Identification:</strong> Each token has a unique ID. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Ownership Tracking:</strong> The standard allows for tracking the owner of each unique token. ¬†</li>
<li><strong>Transferability:</strong> It defines how NFTs can be transferred between accounts. ¬†
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, ERC-721 provides a standardized way to represent ownership of unique digital or physical assets on the blockchain, making them tradable and manageable. ¬†</p>

<p><strong>Creation of a Merkle Tree</strong></p>

<p>A Merkle Tree is a hierarchical data structure used to verify the integrity of data efficiently. Here's how it is constructed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Leaf Nodes</strong><br>
Each data block (e.g., transactions in a blockchain) is hashed individually using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256).<br></li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Pairing and Hashing</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Even Number of Leaves</strong>: Pair adjacent hashes and hash them together.<br></li>
<li><strong>Odd Number of Leaves</strong>: Duplicate the last hash to form a pair.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Step 3: Building the Tree</strong><br>
Repeat the pairing process recursively until a single root hash remains:

<ul>
<li>Combine parent nodes to form higher-level nodes.</li>
<li>Final root hash is the¬†<strong>Merkle Root</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Merkle Root: Usage and Importance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data Integrity</strong>

<ul>
<li>Any alteration to a transaction (e.g., changing L1) changes its hash, propagating up the tree and altering the Merkle Root.</li>
<li>The Merkle Root is embedded in the¬†<strong>block header</strong>¬†(e.g., in Bitcoin), making tampering evident.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Efficient Verification</strong>

<ul>
<li>Nodes can verify the inclusion of a transaction without downloading the entire dataset.</li>
<li>Used in¬†<strong>Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)</strong>¬†for lightweight clients (e.g., mobile wallets).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Merkle Proof: Efficient Transaction Verification</strong></p>

<p>A¬†<strong>Merkle Proof</strong>¬†is a cryptographic proof that a specific transaction is included in a block.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Verify a Merkle Proof</strong>¬†(using L3 as an example):</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with the transaction hash:¬†<code>Hash(L3)</code>.</li>
<li>Combine it with its sibling hash (<code>Hash(L4)</code>) to compute:<br>
<code>Hash(Hash(L3) + Hash(L4))</code>¬†‚Üí Parent Node 2.</li>
<li>Combine Parent Node 2 with its sibling (Parent Node 1) to compute:<br>
<code>Hash(Parent Node 1 + Parent Node 2)</code>¬†‚Üí Merkle Root.</li>
<li>Compare the computed Merkle Root with the one in the block header. A match confirms the transaction's validity.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blockchain</strong>

<ul>
<li>The most famous type of DLT, where data is organized into a chain of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions or records, linked to the previous block via a cryptographic hash.</li>
<li>Examples:

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin: A public blockchain for decentralized currency.</li>
<li>Ethereum: A public blockchain with smart contract functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250227221950.webp" alt="|573" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DAG</strong> (Directed Acyclic Graph)

<ul>
<li>Instead of a linear chain, DAG-based DLT organizes transactions in a graph structure where each transaction confirms one or more previous transactions, forming a web-like network with no cycles (hence ‚Äúacyclic‚Äù).</li>
<li>Example:</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250228102605.webp" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holochain</strong>

<ul>
<li>Each participant has their own chain which contains the list of actions (create, delete, update) performed by the participant (also called personal data journal or source chain), and data is validated through a distributed hash table (DHT).</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Holo: A platform for decentralized apps and hosting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250228103205.webp" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hashgraph</strong>

<ul>
<li>A specific flavor of DLT (sometimes grouped with DAGs) that uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting to achieve consensus.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250228103610.webp" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Tempo</strong> (Radix)

<ul>
<li>Uses a tempo ledger that combines elements of blockchain and DAG.</li>
<li>It stores the transactions in blockchain as well as DAG format. Blockchain helps to provide the audit trail. DAG allows for parallel processing thereby enabling network scalability and efficiency.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="../Premium/UT1/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250228000712.webp" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Definition:

<ul>
<li>Introduced in 2017 via BIP 141</li>
<li>Segregated Witness (SegWit) separates the &quot;witness&quot; data (signatures and public keys) from the main transaction data (inputs, outputs, etc.).</li>
<li>This witness data is stored in a separate section of the block, not counted fully toward the traditional 1 MB block size limit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact on TPS:

<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Block Capacity</strong>: By segregating witness data, SegWit effectively raises the block size limit to approximately 4 MB.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller Transactions</strong>: Removing signatures from the main data reduces transaction size, allowing more to fit in each block.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Throughput</strong>: While Bitcoin‚Äôs base TPS is around 7 (due to 10-minute block intervals), SegWit increases on-chain capacity and supports off-chain scaling, indirectly raising the effective TPS.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Network</strong>
<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: A pre-SegWit block might fit 2,000 transactions, while a SegWit block could fit 3,000+, enhancing throughput and supporting scalable solutions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>A private key is like your secret password for your Bitcoin. It‚Äôs a long, random number you keep hidden, used to sign transactions to prove you own the funds. If someone gets your private key, they can spend your Bitcoin, so it‚Äôs critical to keep it safe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>Think of the public key as a lock that matches your private key, the key. It‚Äôs derived from the private key and used to verify that transactions are signed by you. You can share it, and it‚Äôs used to create your Bitcoin address.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Bitcoin Address</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is like your Bitcoin bank account number, a shorter version of the public key made by hashing it. People use it to send Bitcoin to you. It starts with numbers or letters, like ‚Äú1‚Äù or ‚Äú3,‚Äù depending on the type.</p>

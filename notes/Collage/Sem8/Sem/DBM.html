Explain digital signature (5, 2024 May)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cryptographic algorithms are mathematical functions used to encrypt (scramble) plaintext into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong>

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../UT2/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250419015459.webp" alt="" /></li>
<li>Mathematical schemes that demonstrate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Alice uses her private key to create a digital signature for a document. Bob receives the document and verifies the signature using Alice's public key, confirming that Alice sent the document and that it hasn't been altered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Digital Certificates:</strong>

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="../UT2/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250419015352.webp" alt="" /></li>
<li>Electronic documents that associate a public key with an identity (e.g., a person, organization, server). They are issued by a trusted third party called a Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A website obtains an SSL certificate from a CA. This certificate contains the website's public key and identity information, allowing users' browsers to verify the website's authenticity and establish a secure connection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for Security:</strong>

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="./assets/Pasted%20image%2020250517202356.webp" alt="" /></li>
<li>A system for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates. It provides a framework for secure communication and authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A company uses a PKI to issue digital certificates to its employees for secure email communication and access to internal resources. The PKI includes CAs, registration authorities, and certificate repositories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>SSL:</strong>

<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="./assets/Pasted%20image%2020250517201822.webp" alt="" /></li>
<li>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security): A cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a network, often used for web browsing (HTTPS).</li>

<p>E-commerce involves online buying and selling. Threats arise from using the internet for theft, fraud, and security breaches. These threats can be accidental, intentional, or due to human error.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Electronic Payment System Risks:</strong> Electronic payment systems are crucial for e-commerce, enabling paperless transactions and reducing costs. However, they pose several risks:

<ul>
<li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Authentication methods like passwords and security questions can be compromised, allowing unauthorized access to funds.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Evasion:</strong> The digital nature of electronic payments can complicate tax compliance verification for revenue services.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Conflicts:</strong> Automated systems handling frequent, large-volume transactions with multiple recipients are prone to errors and technical glitches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>E-cash Threats:</strong> E-cash is an anonymous paperless fund transfer system. While convenient, storing financial information digitally makes it vulnerable to hackers. Major threats include:

<ul>
<li><strong>Backdoor Attacks:</strong> Attackers gain unauthorized system access, bypassing normal authentication and remaining hidden.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attackers disrupt access for legitimate users by overwhelming network resources.</li>
<li><strong>Eavesdropping:</strong> Unauthorized interception of private online communications occurs without detection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Credit/Debit Card Fraud:</strong> Credit cards allow borrowing for purchases, while debit cards use deposited funds. Associated threats include:

<ul>
<li><strong>ATM Skimming:</strong> Devices attached to card readers steal card details (number, name, CVV, expiry).</li>
<li><strong>Vishing/Phishing:</strong> Attackers deceive users via phone calls (vishing) or SMS (smishing) posing as legitimate entities to obtain sensitive information like PINs and account details.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Greater Information Access</strong>: Consumers gain more choice and information through the internet, easily comparing prices and accessing details instantly, such as for travel or shopping.</li>
<li><strong>Time Savings</strong>: Online ordering and delivery (e.g., office supplies arriving next day) reduce the need for physical trips, cutting labor costs and boosting efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Costs</strong>: Businesses save on physical infrastructure by operating online, bypassing retail middlemen and offering lower prices direct from warehouses.<br></li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Digital platforms enable tailored products (e.g., custom clothes via 3D printing), meeting individual preferences beyond what traditional stores can stock.</li>

<h2><a name="explain-need-of-modulation-justify-it-with-example" class="heading-anchor" href="#explain-need-of-modulation-justify-it-with-example" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Explain need of modulation. Justify it with example.</h2>
<p>Modulation is the process of encoding information onto a carrier signal for the
purpose of transmitting it over a communication channel. The need for modulation
arises because the information to be transmitted is usually in the form of a
low-frequency signal, while the communication channel can only support
high-frequency signals. By encoding the low-frequency information onto a
high-frequency carrier signal, the information can be transmitted over the
communication channel more efficiently.</p>

<p>For example, consider the transmission of audio signals over a radio channel.
The audio signals to be transmitted have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20,000
Hz, which is too low for efficient transmission over a radio channel. To
transmit the audio signals over the radio channel, the audio signals are
modulated onto a high-frequency carrier signal, typically in the range of 87.5
MHz to 108 MHz. The modulated signal can then be transmitted over the radio
channel, and the original audio signals can be recovered by demodulating the
received signal.</p>

<p>In summary, modulation is necessary to enable the efficient transmission of
low-frequency signals over communication channels that only support
high-frequency signals.</p>
<h2><a name="define-the-following-terms" class="heading-anchor" href="#define-the-following-terms" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Define the following terms.</h2><h3><a name="noise-figure" class="heading-anchor" href="#noise-figure" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Noise Figure</h3>
<p>The noise figure is a measure of the degradation of the signal-to-noise ration
(SNR) that occurs in a communication sytem due to thermal noise, amplification
noise, and other sources of nise. It is expressed in decibels(dB) and represents
the ratio of the input SNR to the output SNR of a system.</p>
<h3><a name="noise-temperature" class="heading-anchor" href="#noise-temperature" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Noise Temperature</h3>
<p>The noise temperature is a physical quantity that describes the amount of
thermal noise generated by a system, in terms of the equivalent temperature of a
resistor generating the same amount of noise power. It is used to characterize
the performance of communication systems, particularly amplifiers, and is often
expressed in kelvin (K).</p>
<h3><a name="noise-bandwidth" class="heading-anchor" href="#noise-bandwidth" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Noise Bandwidth</h3>
<p>The noise bandwidth is the bandwidth over which thermal noise is generated in a
communication system. It is a measure of the frequency range over which the
noise power is generated and is often used in the calculation of noise figure
and noise temperature.</p>
<h3><a name="noise-voltage" class="heading-anchor" href="#noise-voltage" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Noise Voltage</h3>
<p>The noise voltage is the electrical voltage that is generated by thermal noise
in a system. It is a measure of the random fluctuation in the voltage that
result from thermal noise and can be expressed in terms of a root mean square
(RMS) value.</p>
<h3><a name="modulation" class="heading-anchor" href="#modulation" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Modulation</h3>
<p>Modulation is the process of encoding information onto a carrier signal for the
purpose of transmitting it over a communication channel. Modulation is performed
by modifying the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the carrier signal in a
manner that is proportional to the information signal, so that the information
can be transmitted over the communication channel. The process of recovering the
original information from the modulated signal is known as demodulation.</p>
<h2><a name="type-of-noise" class="heading-anchor" href="#type-of-noise" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Type of Noise</h2>
<p><img src="type-of-noise.png" alt="Type of Noise Diagram"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Short Noise</strong> it is a type of electronic noise which generated due to random fluctuations in the flow of electric current in conductor. Short noise is Poisson process, which means that its occurrence is not predictable and its amplitude is proportional to the square root of average current. For example, the short noise in a resistor is proportional to th square root of the current flowing through it.</li>
<li><strong>Thermal Noise</strong> it is also know as Johnson-Nyquist noise of Johnson noise. It is generated due to random thermal motion of electrons in a conductor. The thermal noise is proportional to the temperature of the conductor and the resistance of the conductor. For example, the thermal noise is resistor is proportional to the temperature of the resistor and its resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Transit Time Noise</strong> - It is generated due to the random fluctuatons in the transit time of electrons passing through a devic such a bipolar dunction transistor or a field-effect transistor. The transit time noise is proportional to the square root of the frequency of the signal being transmitted.</li>
<li><strong>Flicker Noise</strong> it is also know as 1/f noise. it is generated due to the random fluctuation in vurrent flow in a conductor and is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency of the signal. Flicker noise is most pronounced at low frequencies.</li>
<li><strong>Partition Noise</strong> it is generated due to the random fluctuation in the number of carriers in a particular energy level of a semiconductor device. Partition noise is proportional to the square root of the number of carriers in the energy level.</li>

<p>The fourier transform is a mathematical tool used to analyze signals and
transform them into the frequency domain. It is a way of representing signals as
the of their constituent sinusoidal frequencies, allowing us to understand the
frequency content of signals and perform operations such as filtering and
compression.</p>

<p>The fouier transform is widely used in various fields, including signal
processing, image processing, audio processing, control systems, and more.</p>

<p>It is used to analyze and understand the frequency content of signals, filter
signals, and perform other operations on signals.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Formula</strong> $f(x) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} F(k)e^{2\pi ikx}dk$</li>
<li><strong>Lineaity Transform</strong> The fourier transform is linear operation, which means
that if a function is linear combination of other function, then its Fourier
Transform is also linear combination of their Fourier Transforms. This
property allows for a straightforward and mathematical representation of
signals.</li>
<li><strong>Duality</strong> The Fourier Transform has a duality property, which means that the
Fourier Transform of a function and its inverse Fourier Transform are realted.
This property enables the transformation of signal from the frequency its
inverse Fourier Transform are realted. This property enables the
transformation of a signal from the frequency domain back to the time domain,
providing a complete representaion of the signal.</li>
<li><strong>Modulation Property</strong> The Fourier Transform also has modulation property,
which states that multiplying a signal in the time domain by a complex
exponential results in phase shift in the frequency domain. This property
enables the representation of signals with phase information, providing a more
complete description of the signal.</li>
<li><strong>Time Shifting</strong> The Fourier Transform of a time-shifted signal can be found
by multiplying the Fourier Transform of the original signal by a complex
exponential. This results in a phase shift in the frequency domain, which
corresponds to a time shift in the time domain.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency Shifting</strong> The Fourier Transform of a frequency-shifted signal can
be found by multiplying the Fourier Transform of the original signal by a
complex exponential. This results in a phase shift in the frequency domain,
which corresponds to a frequency shift in the time domain.</li>
<li><strong>Fourier Transform of Unit Step Function</strong> The Fourier Transform of the unit
step function is a sinc function in the frequency domain. The sinc function
has an infinite range and represents the frequencies present in the signal.
Fourier Transform of Delta Function: The Fourier Transform of the delta
function is a constant in the frequency domain. The constant represents the
amplitude of the frequency present in the signal.</li>
<li><strong>Fourier Transform of Gate Function</strong> The Fourier Transform of a gate
function, also known as a rectangular pulse, is a sinc function in the
frequency domain. The sinc function has an infinite range and represents the
frequencies present in the signal.</li>

<p><img src="am-trans.png" alt="AM Transmitter Diagram"></p>

<ul>
<li>An amplitude modulation (AM) tansmitter is a device that generates an amplitude modulated signal from a baseband input signal.</li>
<li>The main components of an AM transmitter are the modulator, oscillator, and power amplifier.</li>
<li>The modulator takes  the baseband input signal and modulates it with carrier wave.

<ul>
<li><strong>Modulation</strong> The baseband signal is multiplied with the carrier signal to produce the modulated signal. The modulated signal has the information carried by the baseband signal embedded in its amplitude.</li>

<h2><a name="frequency-modulation-fm" class="heading-anchor" href="#frequency-modulation-fm" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Frequency Modulation(FM)</h2>
<p><img src="fm.png" alt="FM Modulation">
Frequency Modulation (FM) is a type of analog modulation technique used to transmit audio and voice signals over long distances. In this method, the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the amplitude of
the modulating signal. The principles of Frequency Modulation are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modulating Signal</strong> The information to be transmitted is carried by the modulating signal, which is in the form of an audio signal.</li>
<li><strong>Carrier Signal</strong> The modulating signal is then applied to the carrier signal to produce the frequency modulated signal. The carrier signal is usually a high frequency signal.</li>
<li><strong>Deviation</strong> The amount by which the frequency of the carrier signal is changed is referred to as deviation. The deviation is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal.</li>
<li><strong>Modulated Frequency</strong> The modulated frequency of the carrier signal is given by the sum of the carrier frequency and the deviation. The modulated frequency is a function of the modulating signal amplitude.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> FM signals have a much wider bandwidth compared to AM signals. The bandwidth is proportional to the deviation and the highest audio frequency present in the modulating signal.</li>
<li><strong>Noise Immunity</strong> FM signals are less susceptible to noise compared to AM signals, as the frequency deviation is proportional to the modulating signal amplitude and not the carrier amplitude.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency Stability</strong> The frequency stability of the carrier signal is important for the proper functioning of FM systems. The frequency stability is maintained by using high-stability oscillators.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="pre-emphasis-de-emphasis-in-fm" class="heading-anchor" href="#pre-emphasis-de-emphasis-in-fm" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Pre-emphasis &amp; de emphasis in FM</h3>
<p><img src="pre-de-fm.png" alt="Pre emphasis &amp; de emphasis Diagram"></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-emphasis</strong> It is a technique used to boost the high frequency components of an FM signal before transmission. The purpose of pre-emphasis is to counteract the effect of atmospheric noise and other forms of interference, which tend to reduce the high frequency components of an FM signal. The pre-emphasis circuit adds a high-pass filter to the audio signal, increasing the amplitude of the higher frequency components.</li>
<li><strong>De-emphasis</strong> It is the reverse process of pre-emphasis. After the FM signal has been received and demodulated, the de-emphasis circuit is used to restore the original audio signal. The de-emphasis circuit is a low-pass filter that reduces the amplitude of the higher frequency components. This is done to restore the original audio signal and to eliminate any residual noise or interference that may have been introduced during transmission.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, pre-emphasis and de-emphasis are used to enhance the quality of an FM signal by emphasizing the high frequency components before transmission and de-emphasizing them after transmission.</p>
<h3><a name="indirect-method-armstrong-method-of-fm-generation" class="heading-anchor" href="#indirect-method-armstrong-method-of-fm-generation" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Indirect method (Armstrong method) of FM generation.</h3>
<p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ8WAEYd_I5PBAvmu0rBiiUwgGt3UqDXKtTTQ&amp;usqp=CAU" alt="Indirect method Diagram">
The Indirect method or Armstrong method of FM generation involves generating a modulating signal and using it
to modulate a high-frequency carrier signal. This method uses the concept of phase modulation where the phase
of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal. The steps involved in
generating FM using this method are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generation of modulating signal</strong> The modulating signal is a low-frequency signal that is to be used to modulate the carrier signal. This signal could be either audio or message signal.</li>
<li><strong>Amplitude Limiting</strong> The modulating signal is amplitude limited to ensure that the modulating signal does not exceed a certain amplitude level. This is done to prevent over-modulation.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing the Modulating and Carrier Signals</strong> The modulated signal is then mixed with a high-frequency
carrier signal. The carrier signal is generated by an oscillator, and its frequency is much higher than the
frequency of the modulating signal.</li>
<li><strong>Phase Modulation</strong> The phase of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal. This process is known as phase modulation and results in the generation of FM signal.</li>
<li><strong>Detection of FM Signal</strong> The generated FM signal is then passed through a demodulator, which converts it
back to the original modulating signal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method of FM generation is also known as Indirect FM generation as it involves generating FM indirectly by
modulating a high-frequency carrier signal with the modulating signal. The advantage of this method over Direct
FM generation is that it is more stable and efficient.</p>

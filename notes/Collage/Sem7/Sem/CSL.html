<p>DoS and DDoS attacks are cyberattacks designed to disrupt the availability of a target system or network. They achieve this by overwhelming the target with excessive traffic, making it difficult or impossible for legitimate users to access the system.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DoS Attack</strong>

<ul>
<li>A DoS attack involves a single system flooding a target with traffic.</li>
<li>The attacker typically uses a single compromised system to launch the attack.</li>
<li>This makes it relatively easy to identify and mitigate the attack source.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>DDoS Attack</strong>

<ul>
<li>A DDoS attack is a more sophisticated version of a DoS attack. It involves multiple systems, often controlled by a botnet, to launch the attack.</li>
<li>This makes it difficult to identify and mitigate the attack source, as the traffic appears to be coming from multiple legitimate sources.</li>
<li><strong>Types of DDoS Attacks</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Volume-Based Attacks</strong>: Aim to saturate the bandwidth of the target, using techniques like ICMP floods or UDP floods.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol Attacks</strong>: Exploit weaknesses in layer 3 and layer 4 protocols (e.g., SYN floods, Ping of Death).</li>
<li><strong>Application Layer Attacks</strong>: Target web applications and services, aiming to exhaust resources by sending numerous legitimate-looking requests.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020241102004026.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Buffer overflow attacks occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, leading to the overwriting of adjacent memory.</p>

<p>This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, crash the program, or corrupt data.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Buffer Overflow Attacks</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stack Buffer Overflow</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This occurs in the stack memory, typically when local variables exceed their allocated space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Heap Buffer Overflow</strong>:

<ul>
<li>This happens in the heap memory where dynamic memory allocation occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Integer Overflow</strong>:

<ul>
<li>When arithmetic operations exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a variable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Format String Vulnerabilities</strong>:

<ul>
<li>These occur when user input is improperly handled in format strings (e.g., <code>printf</code>). Attackers can manipulate the format string to read or write memory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Mitigating Buffer Overflow Attacks</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Secure Coding Practices:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious input from being processed.</li>
<li><strong>Use Safe Programming Languages</strong>: Languages like Python, Java, and Rust automatically manage memory and provide built-in protections against buffer overflows.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Library Functions:</strong> Use safe library functions that perform bounds checking, such as <code>strncpy</code> and <code>snprintf</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Dangerous Functions:</strong> Avoid using functions like <code>gets</code> and <code>sprintf</code> that are prone to buffer overflows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Compiler-Based Protections:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stack Canaries:</strong> A canary value is placed between the buffer and the return address on the stack. If the canary is overwritten, it indicates a potential attack.</li>
<li><strong>Data Execution Prevention (DEP):</strong> Prevents the execution of code from data segments like the stack and heap, making it harder for attackers to execute malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use Compiler Security Features</strong>: Compilers like GCC and Clang offer options to enable buffer overflow protections (e.g., <code>-fstack-protector</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Runtime Protection:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Memory Protection:</strong> Uses hardware and software techniques to protect memory regions from unauthorized access and modification.</li>
<li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Monitor network traffic and system logs for signs of attacks, including buffer overflows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regular Software Updates:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Keep software up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

(2023 Dec) (2022) (2023 May 5 Marks)</h2>
<p><strong>SOX</strong></p>

<p>SOX compliance refers to adherence to the <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</strong> (SOX), a U.S. federal law enacted in 2002 in response to major corporate scandals, such as Enron and WorldCom.</p>

<p>It sets new standards for financial reporting for publicly traded companies. Its primary goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of corporate financial information.</p>

<p><strong>Key provisions of SOX include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Audit Committee Requirements:</strong> Public companies must establish an independent audit committee to oversee the company's financial reporting processes.</li>
<li><strong>CEO and CFO Certification:</strong> The CEO and CFO must certify the accuracy of the company's financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Controls:</strong> Companies must establish and maintain effective internal controls to ensure the reliability of their financial reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibition of Personal Loans:</strong> Corporate officers are prohibited from receiving personal loans from the company.</li>
<li><strong>Auditor Independence:</strong> Auditors must be independent from the companies they audit.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Non-compliance with SOX</strong> can result in significant penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Adherence to SOX is essential for maintaining investor confidence and protecting the integrity of the financial markets.</p>

<p><strong>HIPAA</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Health Insurance¬†Portability and¬†Accountability¬†Act</strong> (HIPAA) is¬†a U.S. federal¬†law enacted in¬†1996 that establishes¬†national standards¬†for the protection¬†of individuals' medical records¬†and other personal¬†health information¬†(PHI).</p>

<p>HIPAA compliance¬†is crucial for¬†healthcare providers, health plans, and business¬†associates who¬†handle PHI, ensuring¬†the confidentiality, integrity, and¬†availability¬†of sensitive¬†patient data.</p>

<p><strong>HIPAA components:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Privacy Rule

<ul>
<li>Protects patient health information (PHI)</li>
<li>Gives patients rights to access and correct their records</li>
<li>Applies to healthcare providers, plans, and clearinghouses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security Rule

<ul>
<li>Protects electronic health information (ePHI)</li>
<li>Requires three types of safeguards:

<ul>
<li>Administrative (policies and procedures)</li>
<li>Physical (facility and equipment protection)</li>
<li>Technical (data protection and access control)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breach Notification Rule

<ul>
<li>Requires notification of PHI breaches within 60 days</li>
<li>Must notify affected individuals, HHS, and sometimes media</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business Associate Agreements

<ul>
<li>Required for entities handling PHI on behalf of healthcare providers</li>
<li>Ensures third parties follow HIPAA standards</li>
<li>Includes contractors, vendors, and service providers</li>
</ul></li>

<p>A SQL injection attack is a type of cyberattack where malicious SQL code is inserted into an application's input fields to manipulate its database. By injecting malicious code, attackers can potentially steal sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even gain unauthorized access to the system.</p>

<p><strong>Types of SQL Injection</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>In-Band SQLi</strong>: The attacker can use the same channel to both launch the attack and gather results (e.g., using UNION SELECT).</li>
<li><strong>Inferential SQLi</strong>: No data is transferred via the web application, but the attacker reconstructs the database structure by observing the application's behavior (e.g., boolean-based or time-based).</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-Band SQLi</strong>: Data is retrieved using a different channel (e.g., sending the results via email or to an external server).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Countermeasures to Prevent SQL Injection:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries</strong>: Separate the SQL query structure from the data, preventing malicious input from being interpreted as code.</li>
<li><strong>Input Validation and Sanitization</strong>: Check user input for validity and remove harmful characters.</li>
<li><strong>Output Encoding</strong>: Properly encode output to prevent XSS attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Least Privilege Principle</strong>: Grant database users only the necessary permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):</strong> Filter and block malicious traffic.</li>

How it is exploit by attacker to cause cyber attack? (2022) (2023 Dec 5 Marks)</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/how-a-botnet-works.avif" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Botnets</strong> are networks of compromised computers or devices (often called &quot;bots&quot; or &quot;zombies&quot;) that are controlled by an attacker to perform automated tasks. These networks can consist of thousands or even millions of infected devices, including personal computers, servers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</p>

<p><strong>How Botnets Work</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Infection</strong>: Attackers typically infect devices using malware, which can be distributed through malicious emails, compromised websites, or vulnerabilities in software. Once infected, the device becomes part of the botnet.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: The attacker uses a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server to manage the botnet. This server sends commands to the infected devices, directing them to carry out specific actions.</li>
<li><strong>Execution of Tasks</strong>: Bots can be instructed to perform various malicious activities, such as sending spam emails, stealing data, or launching attacks on target systems.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Exploitation by Attackers</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</strong>: Attackers can command all the bots in the network to flood a target server with traffic, overwhelming it and causing downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Spam Distribution</strong>: Botnets can be used to send massive amounts of spam emails, often for phishing attacks or distributing additional malware.</li>
<li><strong>Data Theft</strong>: Attackers can use infected devices to gather sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information, or personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrency Mining</strong>: Some botnets are designed to use the processing power of infected devices to mine cryptocurrency, benefiting the attacker without the owner's knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Credential Stuffing</strong>: Using stolen credentials, attackers can automate login attempts across various sites, exploiting accounts that have reused passwords.</li>

<h2><a name="steganography-2023-may" class="heading-anchor" href="#steganography-2023-may" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Steganography (2023 May)</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HytqM3iah.png" alt="Steganography Working Diagram" /></p>

<p><strong>Steganography</strong> is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a file, making the hidden message undetectable. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on encrypting the message to make it unreadable, steganography aims to hide the very existence of the message.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Steganography Work?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Carrier File:</strong> This is the file that will conceal the secret message. It could be an image, audio file, or even a text document.</li>
<li><strong>Secret Message:</strong> The information to be hidden.</li>
<li><strong>Steganographic Algorithm:</strong> This algorithm embeds the secret message into the carrier file in a way that's difficult to detect.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Common Techniques:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography:</strong> This involves modifying the least significant bit of each pixel in an image to store the secret message.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Steganography:</strong> Similar to LSB steganography, this technique modifies the least significant bits of audio samples.</li>
<li><strong>Text Steganography:</strong> This involves hiding information within the formatting of a text document, such as font size, color, or spacing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Applications of Steganography</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Governments and military organizations can use steganography to transmit secret messages without raising suspicion.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Watermarking:</strong> Artists and content creators can embed copyright information or digital signatures into their work.</li>
<li><strong>Data Hiding:</strong> Sensitive data can be hidden within seemingly innocuous files to protect it from unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="trojan-horse-and-backdoor-2023-may" class="heading-anchor" href="#trojan-horse-and-backdoor-2023-may" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Trojan horse and backdoor (2023 May)</h2>
<p><strong>Trojan Horse</strong></p>

<p>A Trojan horse is a type of malicious software disguised as legitimate software. It often comes in the form of a seemingly harmless program, such as a game, utility, or software update. Once installed, it can perform various malicious activities without the user's knowledge, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data theft:</strong> Stealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.</li>
<li><strong>System damage:</strong> Corrupting or deleting files, or rendering the system unusable.</li>
<li><strong>Backdoor installation:</strong> Creating a backdoor to allow remote access to the system.</li>
<li><strong>Botnet creation:</strong> Turning the infected device into part of a botnet, a network of compromised devices controlled by a malicious actor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Types of Trojan Horse:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exploit Trojans</strong>  - These Trojans inject a machine with code deliberately designed to take advantage of a weakness inherent to a specific piece of software.</li>
<li><strong>Rootkit Trojans</strong> - These Trojans are intended to prevent the discovery of malware already infecting a system so that it can affect maximum damage.</li>
<li><strong>SMS Trojan</strong> - These programs can cost you money by sending text messages from your mobile device to premium rate phone numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Trojans</strong> - These are programmed to execute DDoS attacks, where a network or machine is disabled by a flood of requests originating from many different sources.</li>
<li><strong>Downloader Trojans</strong> - These are files written to download additional malware, often including more Trojans, onto a device.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Backdoor</strong></p>

<p>A backdoor is a secret entry point into a computer system that bypasses normal authentication procedures. It allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system remotely. Backdoors can be installed through various means, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Malicious software:</strong> Trojans, worms, and viruses can install backdoors.</li>
<li><strong>Software vulnerabilities:</strong> Exploiting vulnerabilities in software can create backdoors.</li>
<li><strong>Misconfigurations:</strong> Incorrect system configurations can leave backdoors open.</li>

<p><strong>PCI-DSS</strong> (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security requirements designed to protect cardholder data.</p>

<p><strong>Key Requirements of PCI-DSS</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Install and maintain a firewall:</strong> This is to protect cardholder data from unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Do not store full cardholder data:</strong> Only store the last four digits of the card number, expiration date, and service code.</li>
<li><strong>Protect stored cardholder data:</strong> If you must store cardholder data, encrypt it.</li>
<li><strong>Develop, implement, and maintain secure systems and applications:</strong> Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Protect cardholder data in transmission:</strong> Use strong encryption protocols like HTTPS.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Benefits of PCI-DSS Compliance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced risk of data breaches:</strong> Adhering to PCI-DSS can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches that could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced customer trust:</strong> Demonstrating PCI-DSS compliance can boost customer confidence in your organization's ability to protect their sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Improved regulatory compliance:</strong> PCI-DSS often aligns with other industry regulations and standards, simplifying compliance efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Lowered insurance premiums:</strong> Many insurance companies offer discounts to businesses that are PCI-DSS compliant.</li>

<ol>
<li>Mobile Phone Theft

<ul>
<li><strong>Physical theft</strong>: This is the most common type of attack, where a thief physically steals a phone.</li>
<li><strong>Remote theft</strong>: Using apps or services like &quot;Find My Device&quot; or &quot;Locate My iPhone,&quot; a thief can remotely lock or wipe data from a stolen phone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mobile Viruses

<ul>
<li><strong>Malware</strong>: Malicious software can infect a phone through downloads, text messages, or Bluetooth connections.</li>
<li><strong>Spyware</strong>: This type of malware secretly monitors a phone's activities, including calls, messages, and location data.</li>
<li>Ransomware: This encrypts data on a phone and demands a ransom for decryption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mishing

<ul>
<li><strong>Mishing</strong> is a combination of &quot;message&quot; and &quot;phishing.&quot; Attackers send fraudulent text messages, often pretending to be from a trusted source, to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or providing personal information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vishing

<ul>
<li><strong>Vishing</strong> is a combination of &quot;voice&quot; and &quot;phishing.&quot; Attackers make phone calls, often using spoofed numbers, to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smishing

<ul>
<li><strong>Smishing</strong> is a combination of &quot;SMS&quot; and &quot;phishing.&quot; Attackers send fraudulent SMS messages to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or providing personal information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hacking Bluetooth

<ul>
<li><strong>Bluetooth hacking</strong>: Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in Bluetooth connections to gain access to a phone's data or even control it remotely.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="who-are-cyber-criminals" class="heading-anchor" href="#who-are-cyber-criminals" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Who are cyber criminals?</h2>
<p>Most cyber-attacks are spearheaded by individuals or small groups of hackers. However, sizeable, organized crime also exploits the internet.</p>

<p>Professional hackers continuously develop new methods for committing crimes and often form global criminal networks that treat cybercrime as a business. These groups share strategies and tools to execute coordinated attacks from various locations. With the rise of cyber-markets for buying and selling stolen data, tracking these criminals has become increasingly difficult. The internet facilitates anonymous collaboration, allowing attacks to be launched from anywhere. Hackers frequently use compromised computers and disguise their identities, complicating the identification of perpetrators and their methods. Additionally, differing crime laws across countries further complicate international cybercrime cases.</p>

<p>Cybercrime involves such activities as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Child pornography</li>
<li>Credit card fraud</li>
<li>Cyber stalking</li>
<li>Defaming another online</li>
<li>Software piracy</li>
</ul>

<p>Cyber criminals are those who conducts such act. They can be categorised into three groups that reflect their motivation</p>

<ol>
<li>Cyber criminals - hungry for recognition

<ul>
<li>hobby hackers</li>
<li>IT professionals</li>
<li>politically motivated hackers</li>
<li>terrorist organisations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cyber criminals - not interested in recognition

<ul>
<li>psychological perverts</li>
<li>financially motivated hackers</li>
<li>organized criminals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cyber criminals - the insiders

<ul>
<li>disgruntled or formal employees seeking revenge</li>
<li>competing companies using employees to gain economic advantage through damage or theft</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Classifications of cybercrime:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cybercrime against individual</li>
<li>Cybercrime against property</li>
<li>Cybercrime against the organization</li>
<li>Cybercrime against Society</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="cyberdefamation" class="heading-anchor" href="#cyberdefamation" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Cyberdefamation</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240830015455.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cyber defamation is an act of intentionally insulting, defaming, or offending another individual or a party through a virtual medium.</p>

<p>It can be both written and oral. Under our Indian law, the person who defames you can be sued along with the person sharing and reposting that content.</p>

<p>All those actions, <strong>sharing, liking, retweeting and or commenting</strong> may be taken as a republication of defamatory content.</p>

<p>The act of republishing from social media is so simple that users give little thought to the serious consequences which may result.</p>

<p>Most of them think that deleting a story or post afterwards would be enough but Internet keep records, and they could be held responsible for reposting serious negative content.</p>

<p>Libel is written defamation and slander is oral defamation.</p>
<h3><a name="credit-card-fraud" class="heading-anchor" href="#credit-card-fraud" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Credit Card Fraud</h3>
<p>Credit card fraud involves the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card information to make purchases or access funds. It‚Äôs a serious crime that can result in significant financial loss and damage to one's credit history. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what it entails and an example:</p>

<p><strong>Types of Credit Card Fraud</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stolen Card Information</strong>: When someone physically steals a credit card or obtains the card information through methods like phishing or hacking.</li>
<li><strong>Card Not Present (CNP) Fraud</strong>: Occurs when fraudsters use stolen credit card details to make online or phone purchases where the physical card is not required.</li>
<li><strong>Account Takeover</strong>: When a fraudster gains access to a person‚Äôs credit card account, often by stealing login credentials, and then makes unauthorized transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Application Fraud</strong>: When someone uses stolen or fake information to open a new credit card account.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example of Credit Card Fraud</strong>:</p>

<p>Imagine you receive a notification from your bank about suspicious activity on your credit card. Upon reviewing, you discover that several high-value transactions have been made at a luxury retailer that you‚Äôve never visited. After investigating, you learn that your credit card details were stolen and used by a fraudster to make these purchases online.</p>

<p>In this case, the fraudster likely obtained your credit card information through a data breach, phishing email, or by skimming your card at a point-of-sale terminal. They then used the stolen information to make purchases without your consent.</p>

<p>To prevent credit card fraud, it‚Äôs essential to regularly monitor your account for unauthorized transactions, use strong passwords, be cautious with sharing your card information, and report any suspicious activity to your bank immediately.</p>
<h2><a name="explain-phishing-and-its-types-in-detail" class="heading-anchor" href="#explain-phishing-and-its-types-in-detail" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Explain Phishing and its types in detail.</h2>
<p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where an attacker tries to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity. The attacker typically uses fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that mimic legitimate ones to trick the victim.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Phishing</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Email Phishing</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: The most common form, where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from a legitimate source, such as a bank, social media platform, or online service.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You receive an email that looks like it‚Äôs from your bank, asking you to click a link and enter your login credentials to verify your account. The link leads to a fake website designed to capture your information.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240830021429.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spear Phishing</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A more targeted form of phishing where attackers customize their messages to a specific individual or organization, often using information gathered from social media or other sources to make the attack more convincing.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: An attacker sends an email to a company‚Äôs finance department, appearing to come from the CEO, requesting sensitive financial information or urging the recipient to perform a wire transfer.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="assets/article-spear-phishing-vs-phishing_Img0.webp" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Whaling</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A type of spear phishing that specifically targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as executives or important decision-makers.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: An email that appears to come from a trusted source, like a law firm or regulatory body, targets the CEO with a request for confidential business information or a financial transaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Smishing</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Phishing attacks conducted via SMS (text messages). Attackers send messages that appear to be from a legitimate organization, urging the recipient to click on a link or provide personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You receive a text message claiming to be from your bank, stating there‚Äôs an issue with your account and asking you to click a link to resolve it. The link leads to a fake website designed to steal your login details.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240830024932.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: This type of phishing occurs over the phone. Attackers impersonate legitimate entities, such as banks or government agencies, and use social engineering tactics to extract sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from your credit card company, saying there‚Äôs suspicious activity on your account. They ask you to verify your personal information to &quot;secure&quot; your account.</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240830024959.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pharming</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A technique where attackers redirect users from legitimate websites to fake ones to steal their credentials or other sensitive information. This is typically achieved through DNS spoofing or malware.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: You type in the URL for your bank‚Äôs website, but due to pharming, you are redirected to a fake site that looks identical to the real one. You enter your login details, which are then captured by the attackers.</li>

<h2><a name="explain-e-mail-spoofing-software-piracy" class="heading-anchor" href="#explain-e-mail-spoofing-software-piracy" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Explain E-Mail Spoofing, Software piracy.</h2><h3><a name="e-mail-spoofing" class="heading-anchor" href="#e-mail-spoofing" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>E-Mail Spoofing</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240830024221.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A spoofed E-Mail is one that appears to originate from one source but has been sent from
another source.</p>

<p>The goal of spoofing is to trick users into believing the email is from someone they know
or can trust‚Äîin most cases, a colleague, vendor, or brand. Exploiting that trust, the
attacker asks the recipient to divulge information or take some other action.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>An attacker might create an email that looks like it comes from PayPal. The
message tells the user that their account will be suspended if they don‚Äôt click a link,
authenticate into the site, and change the account‚Äôs password. If the user is successfully
tricked and types in credentials, the attacker now has credentials to authenticate into the
targeted user‚Äôs PayPal account, potentially stealing money from the user.</p>

<p>More complex attacks target financial employees and use social engineering and online
reconnaissance to trick a targeted user into sending millions to an attacker‚Äôs bank
account.</p>

<p>To the user, a spoofed email message looks legitimate, and many attackers will take
elements from the official website to make the message more believable.</p>

<h3><a name="software-piracy" class="heading-anchor" href="#software-piracy" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Software piracy</h3>
<p>An attack that involves the unlawful copying, distribution and use of software programs
with the intention of commercial or personal use.</p>

<p>Trademark violations, copyright Infringements and patent violations are often associated with this type of cybercrime.</p>

<p>Software piracy means invalid and out of rule reproduction and distribution of software
applications. Software piracy results in great harm to our economy in the form of social
and economic losses.</p>

<p>These are some of the types of software piracy:</p>

<ul>
<li>INTERNET PIRACY: refers to illegal download of copies on the internet.</li>
<li>END USER PIRACY: refers to copy software without a valid license.</li>
<li>PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE PIRACY: refers to an invalid installation of computer software on multiple systems by a manufacturer.</li>
<li>COUNTERFEITING: refers to the making and selling of duplicated CDs from original software at a lower price.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="explain-the-trojan-horse-and-its-types-in-detail" class="heading-anchor" href="#explain-the-trojan-horse-and-its-types-in-detail" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Explain the Trojan horse and its types in detail.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020240830025453.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Trojan horse is a type of malware that conceals its true content to fool a user into
thinking it's a harmless file. The &quot;payload&quot; carried by a Trojan is unknown to the user,
but it can act as a delivery vehicle for a variety of threats.
Types of Trojan viruses
Some of the most common types of Trojan virus include:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Backdoor Trojans</strong> - This type of Trojan allows hackers to remotely access and control a computer, often for the purpose of uploading, downloading, orexecuting files at will.</li>
<li><strong>Exploit Trojans</strong>  - These Trojans inject a machine with code deliberately designed to take advantage of a weakness inherent to a specific piece of software.</li>
<li><strong>Rootkit Trojans</strong> - These Trojans are intended to prevent the discovery of malware already infecting a system so that it can affect maximum damage.</li>
<li><strong>Banker Trojans</strong> - This type of Trojan specifically targets personal information used for banking and other online transactions.</li>
<li><strong>SMS Trojan</strong> - These programs can cost you money by sending text messages from your mobile device to premium rate phone numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Spy Trojan</strong> -  Trojan-Spy programs can spy on how you're using your computer ‚Äì for example, by tracking the data you enter via your keyboard, taking screenshots, or getting a list of running applications.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Trojans</strong> - These are programmed to execute DDoS attacks, where a network or machine is disabled by a flood of requests originating from many different sources.</li>
<li><strong>Downloader Trojans</strong> - These are files written to download additional malware, often including more Trojans, onto a device.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you suspect your device may have been breached by a Trojan, you should look for many of the same significant signs of malicious software. These may include:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Poor device performance</strong> - Is your computer or mobile device running slowly or crashing more frequently than normal?</li>
<li><strong>Strange device behaviour</strong> - Are programs running you didn‚Äôt initiate or are other unexplained processes being executed on your device?</li>
<li><strong>Pop-up and spam interruptions</strong> - Are you noticing an uptick in the number of interruptions from browser pop-ups or email spam?</li>
</ol>

<p>If your device is exhibiting these symptoms, it‚Äôs possible a Trojan virus has managed to sneak its payload onto your computer.</p>

<p>There are a few best practices in addition to installing cybersecurity software to help keep yourself safe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never download or install software from a source you don‚Äôt trust completely.</li>
<li>Never open an attachment or run a program sent to you in an email from someone you don‚Äôt know.</li>
<li>Keep all software on your computer up to date with the latest patches.</li>
<li>Make sure a Trojan antivirus is installed and running on your computer</li>

<p><strong>Criminals plan the attacks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Reconnaissance

<ul>
<li><strong>Target Identification:</strong> Criminals identify potential targets based on factors like vulnerability, value of data, and ease of access.</li>
<li><strong>Information Gathering:</strong> They collect information about the target's systems, networks, and security measures through various techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> They gather information about individuals within the target organization to identify potential vulnerabilities or points of entry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Passive Attacks

<ul>
<li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Criminals passively observe the target's network traffic, website activity, and social media presence to gather information.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> They identify potential weaknesses in the target's systems and security measures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Active Attacks

<ul>
<li><strong>Scanning:</strong> Criminals actively probe the target's network to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> They exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target's systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scrutinizing and Scanning the Gathered Information

<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Criminals analyze the collected information to identify the most effective attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Planning:</strong> They develop a detailed plan for the attack, including the specific techniques to be used and the desired outcome.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attack

<ul>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> Criminals execute the attack according to their plan, using various techniques like phishing, malware, social engineering, or denial-of-service attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> They may continue to monitor and adjust their attacks based on the target's response.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of cyber criminals</strong></p>

<p>Cyber criminals are those who conducts such act. They can be categorised into three groups that reflect their motivation</p>

<ol>
<li>Cyber criminals - hungry for recognition

<ul>
<li>hobby hackers</li>
<li>IT professionals</li>
<li>politically motivated hackers</li>
<li>terrorist organisations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cyber criminals - not interested in recognition

<ul>
<li>psychological perverts</li>
<li>financially motivated hackers</li>
<li>organized criminals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cyber criminals - the insiders

<ul>
<li>disgruntled or formal employees seeking revenge</li>
<li>competing companies using employees to gain economic advantage through damage or theft</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Social engineering is the ‚Äútechnique to influence‚Äù and ‚Äúpersuasion to deceive‚Äù people to
obtain the information or perform some action.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social engineers exploit the natural tendency of a person to trust social engineers‚Äü word, rather than exploiting computer security holes.</li>
<li>It is generally agreed that people are the weak link in security and this principle makes social engineering possible.</li>
<li>A social engineer usually uses telecommunication (i.e., telephone and/or cell phone) or Internet to get them to do something that is against the security practices and/or policies of the organization.</li>
<li>Social engineering involves gaining sensitive information or unauthorized access privileges by building inappropriate trust relationships with insiders.</li>
<li>It is an art of exploiting the trust of people, which is not doubted while speaking in a normal manner.</li>
<li>The goal of a social engineer is to fool someone into providing valuable information or access to that information.</li>
<li>Social engineer studies the human behaviour so that people will help because of the desire to be helpful, the attitude to trust people, and the fear of getting into trouble.</li>
<li>The sign of truly successful social engineers is that they receive information without any suspicion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Calling a user and pretending to be someone from the service desk working on a network issue; the attacker then proceeds to ask questions about what the user is working on, what file shares he/she uses, what his/her password is, and so on‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Classification of Social Engineering</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Human-Based Social Engineering</li>
<li>Computer-Based Social Engineering</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Human-Based Social Engineering</strong></p>

<p>Human-based social engineering refers to person-to-person interaction to get the required/
desired information.</p>

<p>An example is calling the help desk and trying to find out a password.</p>

<ol>
<li>Impersonating an employee or valid user:

<ul>
<li>Social engineers ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù of the fact that most people are basically helpful, so it seems harmless to tell someone who appears to be lost where the computer room is located, or to let someone into the building who ‚Äúforgot‚Äù his/her badge, etc., or pretending to be an employee or valid user on the system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Posing as an important user:

<ul>
<li>The attacker pretends to be an important user ‚Äì for example, a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or high-level manager who needs immediate assistance to gain access to a system.</li>
<li>The attacker uses intimidation so that a lower-level employee such as a help-desk worker will help him/her in gaining access to the system. Most of the low-level employees will not ask any question to someone who appears to be in a position of authority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using a third person:

<ul>
<li>An attacker pretends to have permission from an authorized source to use a system. This trick is useful when the supposed authorized personnel is on vacation or cannot be contacted for verification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calling technical support:

<ul>
<li>Calling the technical support for assistance is a classic social engineering example.</li>
<li>Help-desk and technical support personnel are trained to help users, which makes them good prey for social engineering attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shoulder surfing:

<ul>
<li>It is a technique of gathering information such as usernames and passwords by watching over a person‚Äüs shoulder while he/she logs into the system, thereby helping an attacker to gain access to the system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dumpster diving:

<ul>
<li>It involves looking in the trash for information written on pieces of paper or computer printouts.</li>
<li>This is a typical North American term; it is used to describe the practice of searching through commercial or residential trash to find useful free items that have been discarded.</li>
<li>It is also called dumpstering, binning, trashing, garbing or garbage gleaning.</li>
<li>‚ÄúScavenging‚Äù is another term to describe these habits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Computer-Based Social Engineering</strong></p>

<p>Computer-based social engineering refers to an attempt made to get the required/desired information by using computer software/Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> sending a fake E-Mail to the user and asking him/her to re-enter a password in a webpage to confirm it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fake E-Mails:

<ul>
<li>The attacker sends fake E-Mails to users in such that the user finds it as areal e-mail. This activity is also called ‚ÄúPhishing‚Äù. It is an attempt to attract the Internet users (netizens) to reveal their personal information, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by impersonating as a trustworthy and legitimate organization or an individual.</li>
<li>Banks, financial institutes and payment gateways are the common targets.</li>
<li>Phishing is typically carried out through E-Mails or instant messaging and often directs users to enter details at a website, usually designed by the attacker with abiding the look and feel of the original website. Thus, Phishing is also an example of social engineering techniques used to fool netizens.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>E-Mail attachments:

<ul>
<li>E-Mail attachments are used to send malicious code to a victims system, which will automatically (e.g. keylogger utility to capture passwords) get executed.</li>
<li>Viruses, Trojans, and worms can be included cleverly into the attachments to entice a victim to open the attachment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pop-up windows:

<ul>
<li>Pop-up windows are also used, in a similar manner to E-Mail attachments. Pop-up windows with specia</li>
</ul></li>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="assets/Key-Elements-of-IT-Act-2000-01.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>The Information Technology Act, 2000 (also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act) is an Act of the Indian Parliament (No 21 of 2000</strong>) notified on <strong>17 October 2000</strong>. It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce. Secondary or subordinate legislation to the IT Act includes the <em>Intermediary Guidelines Rules 2011 and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.</em></p>

<p><strong>The original Act contained 94 sections, divided into 13 chapters and 4 schedules</strong>. The laws apply to the whole of India. If a crime involves a computer or network located in India, persons of other nationalities can also be indicted under the law, The Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures. It also defines cybercrimes and prescribes penalties for them.</p>

<p>The Act directed the formation of a Controller of Certifying Authorities to regulate the issuance of digital signatures. It also established a Cyber Appellate Tribunal to resolve disputes arising from this new law. The Act also amended various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Banker's Book Evidence Act, 1891, and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to make them compliant with new technologies.</p>

<p><strong>A major amendment was made in 2008. It introduced Section 66A which penalized sending &quot;offensive messages&quot;.</strong> It also introduced Section 69, which gave authorities the power of &quot;interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource&quot;. Additionally, it introduced provisions addressing - pornography, child porn, cyber terrorism and voyeurism.</p>

<p><strong>Active Attacks</strong></p>

<p>Active attacks involve the attacker directly modifying or disrupting the target system or network. Some key characteristics of active attacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>The attacker attempts to change or modify the content of messages</li>
<li>They are dangerous to both integrity and availability of data</li>
<li>The victim is informed about the attack</li>
<li>System resources can be changed or damaged</li>
<li>Examples include masquerade, message modification, replay, and denial of service attacks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Passive Attacks</strong></p>

<p>In passive attacks, the attacker simply observes and gathers information without altering anything. Key points about passive attacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>The attacker monitors and copies message contents without modifying them</li>
<li>They are a threat to confidentiality but not integrity or availability</li>
<li>The victim is not informed about the attack</li>
<li>System resources remain unchanged</li>
<li>Examples include eavesdropping and traffic analysis</li>

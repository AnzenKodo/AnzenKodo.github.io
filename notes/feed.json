Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would\ndo a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your\npoem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?\nIt’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and\nsay, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your\nlife worth?”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of\nthe International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family\nwere sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate\ninterest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced\nmajor budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help\npeople connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said\nHadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day\nactivities.”</p>\n<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>\n<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him\nset up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,\nwhile performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered\nquestions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded\nmusic, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his\nteeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions\nof people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t\nnormally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN\nSPACE!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided\n“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to\ndirect Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he\nwas held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to\ndie,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .\n. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m\ngoing to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>\n<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the\nthroat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy\nand life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a\npermanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination\ndidn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer\nGeorge Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or\nfour days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in\nit, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to\nreally have that</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to\ntreat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either\nscribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward\ncomputer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>\n<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to\nFacebook, and blogging at <a href=\"http://rogerebert.com/\">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped\nout posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about\neverything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak\n’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his\ninevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,\nand he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with\nthe world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Steal Like an Artist - Austin Kleon</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oww7oB9rjgw\">Steal Like An Artist: Austin Kleon at TEDxKC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/WMc3yh4Buvk\">Keep Going with Austin Kleon and Debbie Millman | SXSW 2019</a></li>\n<li>Brian Eno, A Year With Swollen Appendices</li>\n<li>Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From</li>\n<li>David Byrne, How Music Works</li>\n<li>Mike Monteiro, Design Is a Job</li>\n<li>Kio Stark, Don’t Go Back to School</li>\n<li>Ian Svenonius, Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock ‘n’ Roll</li>\n<li>Sidney Lumet, Making Movies</li>\n<li>P.T.

      "content_html": "<h1>Personal Values</h1>\n<p>Author: Mark Manson Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 50 Progress:\n✔️</p>\n<h2>Values</h2>\n<h3>Good values are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Evidence-based</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>That “cause” is often what we refer to as our “purpose” and finding it is one\nof the most important endeavors we can take to enhance our health and\nwell-being. But our purpose should be sought not merely through what feels\ngood. It must be considered and reasoned. We must accumulate evidence\nsupporting it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Constructive</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>This is money for why what you value is often not as important as why you\nvalue it. If you value martial arts because you enjoy hurting people, then\nthat’s a bad value. But if you value it because you are in the military and\nwant to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.Controllable</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.\nCreativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because\nyou CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a\nside effect.</li>\n<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,\nstanding up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>\n<h3>Bad values are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Emotion-based</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions\nand are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge\nor information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are\ngenerally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term\ngains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Destructive</li>\n<li>Uncontrollable</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up\nyour life to that thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,\nfeeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being\nalone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,\nsacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>\n<h3>How to change values?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into\nvaluing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite\neffect—they double down).</li>\n<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes\nthis contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.\nToo much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>\n<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The world sucks</li>\n<li>We suck</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of\ntrying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a\nfew. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving\nyour best effort.</li>\n<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always\nneed more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will\nneed more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need\nless money.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control\nwhether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You\ncan always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always\ncontrol if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something\nyou find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>\n<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings\nor even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>\n<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every\naspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with\nyour father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for\nrespect.\n<ul>\n<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>\n<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.\n<ul>\n<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an\nadult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>\n<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,\nbecause to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you\nare obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fault</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to\nmake them perfect too.</li>\n<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>\n<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter\nwhose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big\nhole, start climbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>\n<h3>FAIL</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad\nlong-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.\n<ul>\n<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not\ndoing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where\npursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is\nintrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>\n<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who\ndon’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life\nplans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up\na mountain for a molehill.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right\nreasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to\nnever love at all.</li>\n</ul>",

Colleges\nhave always been more liberal than the American population.</li>\n<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces\n(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and\nmanpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic\nhappens, and it fails to make the news.</li>\n<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared\nwith only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but\nwithout data, you would never know it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement of world\n<ul>\n<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more\nfortunate countries to 81.</li>\n<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>\n<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most\nliberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking\ncountries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist\ncountries of central Europe.</li>\n<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the\nidea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over\ntime.</li>\n<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th\ncentury, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car\naccident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99\npercent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall\nto their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less\nlikely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent\nless likely to be killed on the job.</li>\n<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human\nlife. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward\nmore mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life\nvirtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and\nthey constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that\nthis tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the\nstagnation of progress.</li>\n<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have\nvalues today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement in Lifestyle\n<ul>\n<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in\n2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the\nwashing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the\nIndustrial Revolution.</li>\n<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children\nthan stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>\n<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty\nrate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10\npercent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>\n<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier\nthan their helicoptering parents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human nature\n<ul>\n<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those\nwith meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>\n<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones\nmakes it more meaningful.</li>\n<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,\nstruggle, and worry.</li>\n<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are\nopened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely\nhuman cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past\nand stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of\nacquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability\nto persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and\nefficacy.</li>\n<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to\nthink it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and\nhelplessness.</li>\n<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor\nplummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out\nof desperation rather than greed.</li>\n<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>\n<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an\neffective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biases\n<ul>\n<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,\nto discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>\n<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with\nthe consequences of their opinions.</li>\n<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when\nthey are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are\nafter the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>\n<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as\nmuch as is feasible.</li>\n<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like\nit if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the\nother—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective\nmerits.</li>\n<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their\nbeliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you\nthan to pay attention to those who agree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social Media\n<ul>\n<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,\nfeel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>\n<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and\nthey empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their\nsuccesses.</li>\n<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely\nto want a large number of friend.</li>\n<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the\n1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,\nhave become any less social.</li>\n<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,\nunions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal\ngatherings and via digital media.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tech\n<ul>\n<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed\nto weaponize it.</li>\n<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work\nto defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>\n<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into\npreventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of\nyears of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of\nbiology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Countries\n<ul>\n<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and\nregulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western\nEurope) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to\nlive, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human\nflourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,\nand happiness.</li>\n<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries\nhave gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get\nhappier still.</li>\n<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in\nliberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market\nfreedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>\n<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but\nwhat about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in\nboring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without\nviolence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the\nformer Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cyber Attack\n<ul>\n<li>The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking\nconfidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016\nAmerican election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a\nbotnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.</li>\n<li>Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Weapon\n<ul>\n<li>The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the\nworld’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make\nlousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,\nand citizens of the side that uses them.</li>\n<li>The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works\nagainst the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.</li>\n<li>Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold\nvirus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can\nshake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy\nand kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body\nto body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for\ncholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish\nflu).</li>\n<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States\ncan launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber\naircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a\nfirst strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Forecasters\n<ul>\n<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or\nright-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but\nmisguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event\nwas to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned\nout to be.</li>\n<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they\ncould. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their\nspeech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on\nthe other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not\ncertainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more\nreadily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>\n<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to\nexperience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for\ncognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative\ncomplexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>\n<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are\nneither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their\nabilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as\n“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>\n<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and\nconfirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Religions\n<ul>\n<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are\neducation, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other\nsocial services.</li>\n<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no\nreligion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or\npoverty on the scales.</li>\n<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than\nstay-at-homes, but</li>\n<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is\nas charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer\nwho prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>\n<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced\natheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be\nfanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of\natheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far\nin the 21st.</li>\n<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as\n“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”\ndown from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>\n<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other\nfactors constant.</li>\n<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,\nthey stop believing in miracles.</li>\n<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>\n<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,\nthe more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who care about you?\n<ul>\n<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is\nmeaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>\n<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws\nof the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>\n<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan\nyour children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>\n<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense\nof feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across\nbillions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is\ncosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a\nresponsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in\nwhich we all can flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been\nlowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>\n<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>\n<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the\nthings that happen in the world is that people solve the problems\nconfronting them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><em>Wordsmithing</em> - The making of changes to a text to improve clarity and style.</p>\n<p><em>Catastrophize</em> - Worse then it truly is</p>\n<p><em>Modicum</em> - Small quantity of valuable thing</p>\n<p><em>Emphatic</em> - Forcefully and Clearly</p>\n<p><em>Millennials</em> - Those born after 1980</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the\nliberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed\nit—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong\nmore often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased\ncrime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal\nnumerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our\ncivilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to\nChristian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,\n“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this\nnation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the\nface of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars\nwas spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge\nthat was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your\nmother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet.

As an\ninvestor, you’ll be able to see more clearly, but you’ll still be making\none-eyed gambles.</li>\n<li>Don’t change the system rather aimed to earn status by becoming part of the\nsystem and then changing it from within.</li>\n<li>Agreeable and Disagreeable</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Agreeable- people were happiest in the moments when they doled out compliments\nand praise, smiled and laughed with others, expressed affection, reassured\nothers, and compromised.</li>\n<li>Disagreeable- people’s greatest joy when they were criticizing, confronting,\nor challenging others.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The fall from low to lower hardly hurts. The fall from the middle to low is\ndevastating.</li>\n<li>Research shows that the mistakes we regret are not errors of commission, But\nerrors of omission.</li>\n<li>Pioneers and Settlers</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The pioneers were first movers the initial company to develop or sell a\nproduct.\n<ul>\n<li>47 percent of the failure rate.</li>\n<li>10% of the market share.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The settlers were slower to launch, waiting until the pioneers had c treated a\nmarket before entering.\n<ul>\n<li>8 percent of the failure rate.</li>\n<li>22% of the market share.</li>\n<li>Settlers are often branded as copycats, but this stereotype misses the mark.\nInstead of conforming to the existing demand, they bide their time until\nthey’re ready to introduce something new. Slow to enter because they’re\nworking on revolutionary products, services, or technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of\nevery four fail because of premature scaling—<strong>making investments that the\nmarket isn’t yet ready to support</strong>.</li>\n<li>The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to\nrush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.</li>\n<li>Conceptual &amp; Experimental innovators</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.</li>\n<li>Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.</li>\n<li>Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk\ncopying, themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and\nevolving as they go along.\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.</li>\n<li>45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.</li>\n<li>The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: <strong>instead\nof reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering\nnew one’s</strong>.</li>\n<li>:eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate\nexpertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas\nfrom the past.</strong> Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your\nimagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your\nperipheral vision.</li>\n<li>The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more\nstrongly you identify with an extreme group, <strong>the harder you seek to\ndifferentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values</strong>.</li>\n<li>Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. <strong>When the overlap in\ntactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less\nlikely</strong>. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have\nless to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be\nredundant.</li>\n<li>You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing\nsomething original that challenges the status quo.</li>\n<li>Negative &amp; Ambivalent Relationship</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague\nconsistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.</li>\n<li>Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions\nabout when that person can actually be trusted.\n<ul>\n<li>Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative\nrelationships.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re\nthe ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet\nagain, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.</li>\n<li>People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started\nout negative and then become more positive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince\nthem to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing\ntheirs.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our\nagendas to familiar values that people already hold.</strong></li>\n<li>As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals\noccasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to\nattempt to steal a base.</li>\n<li>Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns\nbelieved in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.</li>\n<li>An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old\nfirstborn.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often\ncoincides with societal expectations.</li>\n<li>Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a\ncheater.”</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person\nin the mirror.</li>\n<li>But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality\nis tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of\nMeena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of <strong>Martin Luther King,\nJr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela</strong>.</li>\n<li>Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star,\nand commitment.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills:\nFounders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or\nscientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.\n<ul>\n<li>Failure rates we’re were worse.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future\npotential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The\nindividuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular\narea, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.\n<ul>\n<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and\nchallenging tasks.</li>\n<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural\nfit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the\ncompany’s values and norms.\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees\nand to the organization.</li>\n<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in\nthe organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the\nmission.</li>\n<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms\nwas zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>\n<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>\n<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model\nand more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>\n<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower\nthan star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>\n<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or\nintegrating a diverse workforce.</li>\n<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too\ninsular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and\nthey’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.\nAs a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more\nreliable financial results than their competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their\nperspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of\ndissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from\npeople who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>\n<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times\nhigher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the\nfounder’s original model.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of\nthe firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on\npotential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>\n<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the\nfounder.</li>\n<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with\ncommitment blueprints.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who\nreinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers\nthrow culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates\ncan improve the culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles\nagainst it than in support of it.</li>\n<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>\n<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the\nprinciples. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>\n<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on\ndifferent values or interpret the same values differently.</li>\n<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and\n<strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act\nin the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear\nof failing.</li>\n<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be\ncrippled by fear.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and\nconvert it into motivation.</li>\n<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering\nevery relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables\nthem to feel a sense of control.</li>\n<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the\ndifficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>\n<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature\npositive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic\nproduct decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too\noptimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention\nto potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to\ntake preventative and corrective actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more\nterrifying than the negative.</li>\n<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>\n<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re\nnot alone.</li>\n<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>\n<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to\nemphasize losses rather than gains.</li>\n<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with\nthe present.</li>\n<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation\nor revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better\nsystem. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>\n<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the\nfirst place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by\npeople, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to\nconsider how they can be improved.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>\n<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is\nincomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or\nwriting process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give\nideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>\n<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,\nand you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s\nalso tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they\nevaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by\npeers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>\n<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from\nLisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to\nspend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of\nbusiness</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.\nThen, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert\nthem into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>\n<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a\nmonthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones\nare worth solving.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do\nyou think this made her feel?”.</li>\n<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Story</h1>\n<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href=\"http://dosomething.org/\">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO\nNancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,\nbecause they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.\nEmployees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have\nto explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because\nthe title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to\ncontribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just\nthirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of\nspeaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for\ndelivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades\ntesting out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the\nthousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different\nmelodies and refrains.</p>\n<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a\nseries of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to\nexplain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.\nExplaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to\nexplain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.\nConsidering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize\nthat some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to\nencourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David\nHofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a\nsignificant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical\nprofessionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent\nmore soap and gel</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their\nearly thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,\nthe vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,\npsychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments\nto changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a\nmajor influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations\nto drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been\ninfluenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their\nmentors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse\nworkforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the\nnavy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he\ndidn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took\non; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and\ndedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same\npassions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and\ncohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your\norganization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever\nencountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.\nHeadquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in\ninvestments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its\nphilosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the\nfounder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a\nword about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any\nsituation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful\nwork and build meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees\nare hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating\nthat’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp\nmodeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the\nprinciples, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and\nevaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s\nalways a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,\nto the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for\nemployees to stay for decades.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,\nbut its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,\nboth of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.\nThey’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in\nthe history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the\ncombined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the\nSteve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone\nspecial. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a\nmeeting with an important potential client:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50\nminutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all\nbecause there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the\noutset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a\n“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who\nattended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A\nto F.</p>\n<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be\nfired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the\ncountry’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,\nthey are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance\nby turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon\nthey saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to\nstart driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,\npedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars\nand trucks at a glacial pace.</p>\n<h1>Questions</h1>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passionate people don’t wear their passion on their sleeves; they have it in\ntheir hearts. – Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They don’t wait for permission to start building something.

For the extreme\ntakers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of\nevery ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four\nwere about themselves alone and no one else.</li>\n<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in\ntheir companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt\nentitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>\n<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms\n<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total\nshareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger\nlosses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung\nfor the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and\nlarger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.\nSometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put\ntheir companies in jeopardy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97\">Giver and Taker</a> On the left\nside is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about\nme. A big photo is self-glorifying.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than\ngunning for them.\n<ul>\n<li>Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success\nof people around them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse\nskills, and power.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to\nknowledge, expertise, and influence.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of\ndealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a\nfavor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they\nget what they want. <strong>This faker style of networking</strong> casts the entire\nenterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make\nconnections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.</li>\n<li>When <strong>people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational\ninformation</strong>. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form\nof punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker\ntendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as\n<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning\nbridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Storys</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored\nwith an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his\ncomputer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech\nserver. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the\nmusic.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band\nskyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lekking</strong> - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their\nestablished positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court\nfemale audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs.

If you don’t make enemies\nout there, it’s easier to succeed. — Randy Komisar</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I have one vice, and I can call it nothing else—it is not to be able to say\nno! — Abraham Lincoln</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a\nmarathon. — Chip Conley</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A service provider.

We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from\ninvestments in meaningful activities and relationships. — Wayne Baker</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social networks have always existed, It is only recently that the Internet has\nprovided a venue for their electronic explosion. . . . From mundane\ncommunication to meeting the love of one’s life to inciting political\nrevolutions, network ties are the conduits by which information and resources\nare spread. — Science</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s better to give before you receive. — Keith Ferrazzi</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you meet people you should be asking yourself, ‘How can I help the other\nperson? — Guy Kawasaki</p>\n</blockquote>",

That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

Are you self-employed or is this client your boss?</li>\n<li>If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.</li>\n<li>By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose wants.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good thing about small clients.\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t need to change what you do to please one client; you need to please only the majority (or yourself).</li>\n<li>If one client needs to leave, it’s OK; you can sincerely wish her well.</li>\n<li>Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).</li>\n<li>You hear hundreds of people’s opinions and stay in touch with what the majority of your clients want.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes happy &amp; fulfilling.</li>\n<li>When you are at something great you don’t feel something big going to happen.</li>\n<li>You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.</li>\n<li>Business improvement.\n<ul>\n<li>Customers satisfaction.\n<ul>\n<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</li>\n<li>Make every decision even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone according to what’s best for your customers.</li>\n<li>If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Important things to remember.\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t let other people play with your fear. Like Saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios. Those are just sales tactics.</li>\n<li>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</li>\n<li>Don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>\n<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. <strong>It’s a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.</strong></li>\n<li>You don’t need something big to improve the business sometimes it’s little things that’s add up.</li>\n<li>People remember you more for the smile that you put on there face then fancy business stuff.</li>\n<li>Always prepare for 2x because anytime it can come.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self-Employed VS Business Owner\n<ul>\n<li>Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles.</li>\n<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Solve problems\n<ul>\n<li>Before trusting someone verify that they can do the job.</li>\n<li>Why businesses keep problems around? (Like- Nord VPN)\n→A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.</li>\n<li>If the company has a problem with your decisions then explain your thought process and philosophy.</li>\n<li>If you are an owner of the company you can be anything. And if don’t feel like doing something then give the role to someone who loves doing that role.</li>\n<li>Don’t freedom but don’t give too much that they can overturn you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start now. No funding needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Personal improvement.\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t follow other people path without making your own path.</li>\n<li>Don’t spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them you should want.</li>\n<li>If present is worse than past, then move back and restart improving where things are good.</li>\n<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.</li>\n<li>Doing work yourself is inefficient but it is what make it so joyful in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Derek Sivers philosophies of Business.\n<ul>\n<li>Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.</li>\n<li>Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.</li>\n<li>When you make a company, you make a utopia. It’s where you design your perfect world.</li>\n<li>Never do anything just for the money.</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</li>\n<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.</li>\n<li>Your business plan is moot. You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.</li>\n<li>Starting with no money is an advantage. You don’t need money to start helping people.</li>\n<li>You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.</li>\n<li>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</li>\n<li>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abdicate</strong> - Surrender or relinquish power or responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterward and the whole party marched down the 6th. I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your picture is on our wall as “Customer of the Year.” We’re all exhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to <a href=\"http://cdbaby.com/\">CDBABY.COM</a>!!

Each one is somebody who got the email and loved it enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers. When you’re thinking of how to make your business</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We answered our phone within two rings, always 7am to 10pm, seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m a student, not a guru.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it’s not a hit, switch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No business plan survives first contact with customers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steve Blank:</p>",

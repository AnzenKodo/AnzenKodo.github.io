Dr. Seuss came\nback and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s\nbooks of all time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter\nuntil my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed.\nBut instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try\nto channel it into my writing and my drawing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but\nthen I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade\nhardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.</p>\n<p>About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel\nwhole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my\nwriting, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell\nthat new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has\nadmitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of\nhis heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized\nhe couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type\nas the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his\nown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Linda Barry, What It Is</li>\n<li>Hugh MacLeod, Ignore Everybody</li>\n<li>Jason Fried + David Heinemeier Hansson, Rework</li>\n<li>Lewis Hyde, The Gift</li>\n<li>Jonathan Lethem, The Ecstasy of Influence</li>\n<li>David Shields, Reality Hunger</li>\n<li>Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics</li>\n<li>Anne Lamott, Bird by Bird</li>\n<li>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow</li>\n<li>Ed Emberley, Make a World</li>\n<li>Dr. Seuss, The Cat in the Hat</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When people call something “original,” nine out of ten times they just don’t\nknow the references or the original sources involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Jonathan Lethem</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Everything that needs to be said has already been said.

      "content_html": "<h1>12 Rules of Life</h1>\n<p>Author: Jordan Peterson\nCreated time: April 14, 2021 4:47 PM\nPage No.: 448\nProgress: ✔️</p>\n<p>Description</p>\n<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n<li></li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Points</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Facts\n<ul>\n<li>90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words.</li>\n<li>We all have twice as many female ancestors as male (imagine that all the women who have ever lived have averaged one child. Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>\n<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>\n<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>\n<li>About ourselves\n<ul>\n<li>Order &amp; Chaos\n<ul>\n<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>\n<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>\n<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rules\n<ul>\n<li>We are rule generators. Humans can’t live without rules.</li>\n<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hierarchy of value\n<ul>\n<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>\n<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emotions\n<ul>\n<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>\n<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Women\n<ul>\n<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>\n<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>\n<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ideologies\n<ul>\n<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>\n<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>\n<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Meaning\n<ul>\n<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>\n<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why we are not equal?\n<ul>\n<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>\n<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>\n<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>\n<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why you compare yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>\n<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>\n<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>\n<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>\n<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who are you?\n<ul>\n<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>\n<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>\n<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>\n<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>\n<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>\n<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>\n<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>\n<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>\n<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What not to do?\n<ul>\n<li>Low self-worth people\n<ul>\n<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>\n<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>\n<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>\n<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How internal critic puts you down?\n<ul>\n<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>\n<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>\n<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>\n<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consequence of remaining silent.\n<ul>\n<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>\n<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>\n<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What people do that they don’t think they do?\n<ul>\n<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>\n<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>\n<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manipulate the World\n<ul>\n<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>\n<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>\n<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>\n<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to stop doing?\n<ul>\n<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>\n<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>\n<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>\n<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>\n<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>\n<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Children\n<ul>\n<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>\n<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About lies\n<ul>\n<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>\n<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>\n<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>\n<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>\n<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to\n<ul>\n<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>\n<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>\n<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women\n<ul>\n<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>\n<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>\n<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>\n<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>\n<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>\n<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>\n<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>\n<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>\n<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>\n<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>About Truth\n<ul>\n<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>\n<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>\n<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>\n<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>\n<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>\n<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>\n<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>\n<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>\n<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>\n<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Self\n<ul>\n<li>Why to take care of yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>\n<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>\n<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>\n<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>\n<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Steps to improve yourself.\n<ul>\n<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>\n<li>Speak your mind.</li>\n<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>\n<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>\n<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>\n<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement Steps\n<ul>\n<li>Start with yourself.</li>\n<li>Take care with yourself.</li>\n<li>Define who you are.</li>\n<li>Refine your personality.</li>\n<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>\n<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to know yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>\n<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>\n<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?\n<ul>\n<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>\n<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>\n<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>\n<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why life is a game?\n<ul>\n<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>\n<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>\n<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>\n<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>\n<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to win?\n<ul>\n<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>\n<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>\n<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture\n<ul>\n<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>\n<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To improve your life aim small.\n<ul>\n<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>\n<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>\n<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>\n<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?\n<ul>\n<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>\n<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>\n<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>\n<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>\n<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>\n<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the truth.</li>\n<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Listening to other people\n<ul>\n<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>\n<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>\n<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>\n<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>\n<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>\n<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>\n<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>\n<li>Don’t blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>\n<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>\n<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>\n<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>\n<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>\n<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>\n<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Relationship\n<ul>\n<li>Why we save people?\n<ul>\n<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>\n<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>\n<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>\n<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why not help some people?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>\n<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>\n<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?\n<ul>\n<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>\n<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>\n<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bad Friends\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>\n<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>\n<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>\n<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>\n<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>\n<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>\n<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>\n<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>\n<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>\n<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>\n<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>\n<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>\n<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>\n<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you. You need to give love before you re</strong>ce<strong>ive it.</strong></li>\n<li>When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Culture\n<ul>\n<li>You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion.</li>\n<li>You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.</li>\n<li>The crowd is by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world and with the people you disagree with.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> - Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>\n<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Nicomachean Ethics — Aristotle</li>\n<li>Orphan X — Gregg Hurwitz</li>\n<li>Notes from Underground — Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>\n<li>Crime and Punishment — Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>\n<li>Beyond Good and Evil — Friedrich Nietzsche</li>\n<li>Lord of the Flies — William Golding</li>\n<li>The Gulag Archipelago — Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Word that produces order from Chaos sacrifices everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Jordan Peterson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first of these rules is that the game is important.

Colleges\nhave always been more liberal than the American population.</li>\n<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces\n(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and\nmanpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic\nhappens, and it fails to make the news.</li>\n<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared\nwith only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but\nwithout data, you would never know it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement of world\n<ul>\n<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more\nfortunate countries to 81.</li>\n<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>\n<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most\nliberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking\ncountries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist\ncountries of central Europe.</li>\n<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the\nidea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over\ntime.</li>\n<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th\ncentury, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car\naccident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99\npercent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall\nto their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less\nlikely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent\nless likely to be killed on the job.</li>\n<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human\nlife. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward\nmore mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life\nvirtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and\nthey constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that\nthis tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the\nstagnation of progress.</li>\n<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have\nvalues today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement in Lifestyle\n<ul>\n<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in\n2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the\nwashing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the\nIndustrial Revolution.</li>\n<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children\nthan stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>\n<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty\nrate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10\npercent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>\n<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier\nthan their helicoptering parents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human nature\n<ul>\n<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those\nwith meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>\n<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones\nmakes it more meaningful.</li>\n<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,\nstruggle, and worry.</li>\n<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are\nopened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely\nhuman cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past\nand stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of\nacquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability\nto persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and\nefficacy.</li>\n<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to\nthink it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and\nhelplessness.</li>\n<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor\nplummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out\nof desperation rather than greed.</li>\n<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>\n<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an\neffective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biases\n<ul>\n<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,\nto discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>\n<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with\nthe consequences of their opinions.</li>\n<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when\nthey are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are\nafter the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>\n<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as\nmuch as is feasible.</li>\n<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like\nit if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the\nother—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective\nmerits.</li>\n<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their\nbeliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you\nthan to pay attention to those who agree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social Media\n<ul>\n<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,\nfeel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>\n<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and\nthey empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their\nsuccesses.</li>\n<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely\nto want a large number of friend.</li>\n<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the\n1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,\nhave become any less social.</li>\n<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,\nunions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal\ngatherings and via digital media.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tech\n<ul>\n<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed\nto weaponize it.</li>\n<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work\nto defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>\n<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into\npreventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of\nyears of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of\nbiology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Countries\n<ul>\n<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and\nregulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western\nEurope) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to\nlive, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human\nflourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,\nand happiness.</li>\n<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries\nhave gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get\nhappier still.</li>\n<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in\nliberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market\nfreedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>\n<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but\nwhat about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in\nboring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without\nviolence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the\nformer Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cyber Attack\n<ul>\n<li>The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking\nconfidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016\nAmerican election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a\nbotnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.</li>\n<li>Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Weapon\n<ul>\n<li>The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the\nworld’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make\nlousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,\nand citizens of the side that uses them.</li>\n<li>The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works\nagainst the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.</li>\n<li>Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold\nvirus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can\nshake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy\nand kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body\nto body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for\ncholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish\nflu).</li>\n<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States\ncan launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber\naircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a\nfirst strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Forecasters\n<ul>\n<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or\nright-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but\nmisguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event\nwas to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned\nout to be.</li>\n<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they\ncould. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their\nspeech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on\nthe other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not\ncertainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more\nreadily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>\n<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to\nexperience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for\ncognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative\ncomplexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>\n<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are\nneither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their\nabilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as\n“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>\n<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and\nconfirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Religions\n<ul>\n<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are\neducation, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other\nsocial services.</li>\n<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no\nreligion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or\npoverty on the scales.</li>\n<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than\nstay-at-homes, but</li>\n<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is\nas charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer\nwho prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>\n<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced\natheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be\nfanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of\natheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far\nin the 21st.</li>\n<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as\n“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”\ndown from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>\n<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other\nfactors constant.</li>\n<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,\nthey stop believing in miracles.</li>\n<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>\n<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,\nthe more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who care about you?\n<ul>\n<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is\nmeaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>\n<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws\nof the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>\n<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan\nyour children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>\n<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense\nof feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across\nbillions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is\ncosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a\nresponsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in\nwhich we all can flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been\nlowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>\n<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>\n<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the\nthings that happen in the world is that people solve the problems\nconfronting them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><em>Wordsmithing</em> - The making of changes to a text to improve clarity and style.</p>\n<p><em>Catastrophize</em> - Worse then it truly is</p>\n<p><em>Modicum</em> - Small quantity of valuable thing</p>\n<p><em>Emphatic</em> - Forcefully and Clearly</p>\n<p><em>Millennials</em> - Those born after 1980</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the\nliberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed\nit—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong\nmore often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased\ncrime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal\nnumerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our\ncivilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to\nChristian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,\n“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this\nnation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the\nface of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars\nwas spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge\nthat was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your\nmother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet. Um .\n. . Could you install it for us?”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Spain was an economic laggard among Western countries, even though Spaniards\nwere highly schooled, because Spanish education was controlled by the Catholic\nChurch, and “the children of the masses received only oral instruction in the\nCreed, the catechism, and a few simple manual skills. . . .

But this means you\nhave less time to be part of your local community.</li>\n<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t\nsee it until we get outside of it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Job Vs Art\n<ul>\n<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing\nsatisfy your entire life.\n<ul>\n<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid\nstability for part of your day, but then need creative time for\nexpression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art\nto the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then\nlong for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid\nfuture. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when\nfactoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a\nfew years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a\nhead choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job\nyour entire life.</li>\n<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.\nKeep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to get inspiration?\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>\n<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to start?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>\n<li>If you love something copy it.

What you want does not matter.

Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.\nIf you want to be famous, you need to pursue that.

But the\nformer self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions\nas if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just\nthe result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t\ndefine who we are in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the\nnext-lower one.\n<ul>\n<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get\nit, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that\nsilver envy.

At the time, my blog\nhad no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the\nrecord.</p>\n<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,\nand it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand\ncomments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>\n<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,\nsomething switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They\nweren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked\nlike me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they\nhad never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,\nbecause they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and\nspewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was\nfunny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the\nspotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some\nfamous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The\nrichest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve\noptimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take\nless money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that\ndeal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,\nentirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t\nsocialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business\ngrow quickly.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —\nsuper productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in\nPortland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused\nglobally.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to\nget fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every\nrequest, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent\nmost of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and\nunfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two\nhours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole\nworld, including that one person.</p>\n<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new\narticles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>\n<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my\ncommunity, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old\ncompany had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.\nCustomers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they\nwished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It\ntook me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients\na favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most\nsuccessful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8\nmillion for thousands of musicians.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Time Paradox — Philip Zimbardo</li>\n<li>Turning Pro — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>The Resistance — Gemma Malley</li>\n<li>The War of Art — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Do the Work — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Ego is the Enemy — Ryan Holiday</li>\n<li>Forever Nomad — Tynan, Rolf Potts, Derek Sivers, Leo Babauta, and Todd Iceton</li>\n<li>Positioning — Al Ries and Jack Trout</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://brightthemag.com/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d\">The Reductive Seduction Of Other People’s Problems</a></p>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Art is useless by definition.

Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m a student, not a guru.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it’s not a hit, switch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No business plan survives first contact with customers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steve Blank:</p>",

So they can never unite to destroy it, and the whole machine is stable. See how beautiful this is?

Before the 1960s, colonial governments and companies fought malaria because their officials often lived in remote outposts like Nigeria’s hill stations and Vietnam’s Marble Mountains. Independence movements led to freedom, but also often to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care.</strong></p>\n<p>What we see here is that independence movements—which the writer clearly believes are a good thing—led to some very concrete and very, very awful results, in addition to this curious abstraction—freedom. Clearly, whatever freedom means in this particular context, it’s such a great positive that even when you add it to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care, the result still exceeds zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what does it mean for a government to be “free,” anyway? Is the government of North Korea “free?” What about ExxonMobil? Or the Democratic Party? I have a fairly good understanding of what it means for a human being to be “free.” When it comes to an organization, especially one which claims to be a “government,” I’m quite without a clue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

On a\nmonthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones\nare worth solving.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do\nyou think this made her feel?”.</li>\n<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Story</h1>\n<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href=\"http://dosomething.org/\">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO\nNancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,\nbecause they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.\nEmployees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have\nto explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because\nthe title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to\ncontribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just\nthirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of\nspeaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for\ndelivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades\ntesting out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the\nthousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different\nmelodies and refrains.</p>\n<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a\nseries of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to\nexplain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.\nExplaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to\nexplain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.\nConsidering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize\nthat some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to\nencourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David\nHofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a\nsignificant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical\nprofessionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent\nmore soap and gel</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their\nearly thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,\nthe vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,\npsychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments\nto changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a\nmajor influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations\nto drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been\ninfluenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their\nmentors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse\nworkforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the\nnavy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he\ndidn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took\non; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and\ndedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same\npassions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and\ncohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your\norganization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever\nencountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.\nHeadquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in\ninvestments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its\nphilosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the\nfounder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a\nword about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any\nsituation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful\nwork and build meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees\nare hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating\nthat’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp\nmodeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the\nprinciples, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and\nevaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s\nalways a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,\nto the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for\nemployees to stay for decades.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,\nbut its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,\nboth of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.\nThey’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in\nthe history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the\ncombined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the\nSteve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone\nspecial. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a\nmeeting with an important potential client:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50\nminutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all\nbecause there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the\noutset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a\n“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who\nattended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A\nto F.</p>\n<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be\nfired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the\ncountry’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,\nthey are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance\nby turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon\nthey saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to\nstart driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,\npedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars\nand trucks at a glacial pace.</p>\n<h1>Questions</h1>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passionate people don’t wear their passion on their sleeves; they have it in\ntheir hearts. – Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They don’t wait for permission to start building something.

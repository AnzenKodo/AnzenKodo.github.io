He tells childhood stories about\nvacuuming and cleaning up after his siblings. When he sold his first book, he\nwas cleaning houses in Manhattan. Now he’s a rich bestselling author and lives\nin a village west of London. Do you know how he spends most of his day? Picking\nup trash on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>That’s right: One of our most popular living authors estimates that he a garbage\ntruck after him: “Pig Pen Sedaris.” He’s best known to his neighbors as a litter\npicker. When the West Sussex County Times wrote about him, they didn’t even\nmention he was a writer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Twenty-Four Hours a Day - Richmond Walker</li>\n<li>The Gift - Lewis Hyde</li>\n<li>Daily Rituals - Mason Currey</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it\nmakes me happy just to do it . . . I think trying to be creative, keeping\nbusy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Willie Nelson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“None of us know what will happen. Don’t spend time worrying about it. Make\nthe most beautiful thing you can. Try to do that every day. That’s it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Laurie Anderson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Annie Dillard</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Relying on craft and routine is a lot less sexy than being an artistic\ngenius. But it is an excellent strategy for not going insane.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Christoph Niemann</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Your list is your past and your future. Carry at all times. Prioritize:\ntoday, this week, and eventually. You will someday die with items still on\nyour list, but for now, while you live, your list helps prioritize what can be\ndone in your limited time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Tom Sachs</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The greatest need of our time is to clean out the enormous mass of mental and\nemotional rubbish that clutters our minds and makes of all political and\nsocial life a mass illness. Without this housecleaning, we cannot begin to\nsee. Unless we see, we cannot think.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Thomas Merton</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common\nsense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Gertrude Stein</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Keep your eye on your inner world and keep away from ads and idiots and movie\nstars.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Dorothea Tanning</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I paint with my back to the world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Agnes Martin</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You have to have done something before you can be said to have done\nsomething. The title of artist or architect or musician needs to somehow be\nearned.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Dave Hickey</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are only responsible for your work so DO IT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Sol LeWitt to Eva Hesse</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No artist can work simply for results; he must also like the work of getting\nthem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Robert Farrar Capon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Don’t make stuff because you want to make money—it will never make you enough\nmoney. And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous—because you will\nnever feel famous enough. Make gifts for people—and work hard on making those\ngifts in the hope that those people will notice and like the gifts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—John Green</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What I’m really concerned about is reaching one person.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Jorge Luis Borges</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s as true today as it ever was: He who seeks beauty will find it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Bill Cunningham</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Drawing is the discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world.

Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark\nugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all\nthe awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part\nof you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,\nrather than against it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>\n<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get\nstronger and healthier and happier.</li>\n<li>Goal vs Habits\n<ul>\n<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X\namount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>\n<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one’s efforts\nfor a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest\nthem in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>\n<li>People don’t develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is\ndifferent.</li>\n<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,\nmake other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.\n<ul>\n<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some\nform of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone\nto quit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You wouldn’t keep watching a TV show you don’t like. You wouldn’t eat an\nentire plate of food you don’t like. So why the hell are you trying to read a\nbook you don’t like?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stores</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Waight Loss\n<ul>\n<li>I know someone who lost a lot of weight (almost 80 lbs) over a 2-year\nperiod. He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know\nhow he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too\noverwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey\nman, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed\nby a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off\nwith a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for\ngood measure.</li>\n<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting\nsomebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

For the extreme\ntakers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of\nevery ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four\nwere about themselves alone and no one else.</li>\n<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in\ntheir companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt\nentitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>\n<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms\n<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total\nshareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger\nlosses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung\nfor the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and\nlarger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.\nSometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put\ntheir companies in jeopardy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97\">Giver and Taker</a> On the left\nside is giver right side is a taker.

Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form\nof punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker\ntendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited.

We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past\nand stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of\nacquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability\nto persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and\nefficacy.</li>\n<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to\nthink it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and\nhelplessness.</li>\n<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor\nplummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out\nof desperation rather than greed.</li>\n<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>\n<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an\neffective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biases\n<ul>\n<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,\nto discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>\n<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with\nthe consequences of their opinions.</li>\n<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when\nthey are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are\nafter the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>\n<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as\nmuch as is feasible.</li>\n<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like\nit if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the\nother—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective\nmerits.</li>\n<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their\nbeliefs.

Germs get greedy\nand kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body\nto body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for\ncholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish\nflu).</li>\n<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States\ncan launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber\naircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a\nfirst strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Forecasters\n<ul>\n<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or\nright-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but\nmisguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event\nwas to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned\nout to be.</li>\n<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they\ncould. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their\nspeech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on\nthe other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not\ncertainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more\nreadily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>\n<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to\nexperience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for\ncognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative\ncomplexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>\n<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are\nneither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their\nabilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as\n“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>\n<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and\nconfirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Religions\n<ul>\n<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are\neducation, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other\nsocial services.</li>\n<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no\nreligion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or\npoverty on the scales.</li>\n<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than\nstay-at-homes, but</li>\n<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is\nas charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer\nwho prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>\n<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced\natheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be\nfanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of\natheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far\nin the 21st.</li>\n<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as\n“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”\ndown from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>\n<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other\nfactors constant.</li>\n<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,\nthey stop believing in miracles.</li>\n<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>\n<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,\nthe more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who care about you?\n<ul>\n<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is\nmeaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>\n<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws\nof the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>\n<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan\nyour children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>\n<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense\nof feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across\nbillions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is\ncosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a\nresponsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in\nwhich we all can flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been\nlowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>\n<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>\n<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the\nthings that happen in the world is that people solve the problems\nconfronting them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><em>Wordsmithing</em> - The making of changes to a text to improve clarity and style.</p>\n<p><em>Catastrophize</em> - Worse then it truly is</p>\n<p><em>Modicum</em> - Small quantity of valuable thing</p>\n<p><em>Emphatic</em> - Forcefully and Clearly</p>\n<p><em>Millennials</em> - Those born after 1980</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the\nliberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed\nit—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong\nmore often than they were right.

So they can never unite to destroy it, and the whole machine is stable. See how beautiful this is? By separating voters into two competing but cooperating parties, neither of which can destroy the other, the two-party system creates a government which will survive indefinitely, no matter how much happier its citizens might be without it.</p>\n<h2>Sentences</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And the world changed. Before the 1960s, colonial governments and companies fought malaria because their officials often lived in remote outposts like Nigeria’s hill stations and Vietnam’s Marble Mountains. Independence movements led to freedom, but also often to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care.</strong></p>\n<p>What we see here is that independence movements—which the writer clearly believes are a good thing—led to some very concrete and very, very awful results, in addition to this curious abstraction—freedom. Clearly, whatever freedom means in this particular context, it’s such a great positive that even when you add it to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care, the result still exceeds zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what does it mean for a government to be “free,” anyway? Is the government of North Korea “free?” What about ExxonMobil? Or the Democratic Party? I have a fairly good understanding of what it means for a human being to be “free.” When it comes to an organization, especially one which claims to be a “government,” I’m quite without a clue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would\ndo a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your\npoem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?\nIt’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and\nsay, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your\nlife worth?”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of\nthe International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family\nwere sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate\ninterest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced\nmajor budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help\npeople connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said\nHadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day\nactivities.”</p>\n<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>\n<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him\nset up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,\nwhile performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered\nquestions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded\nmusic, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his\nteeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions\nof people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t\nnormally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN\nSPACE!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided\n“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to\ndirect Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he\nwas held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to\ndie,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .\n. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m\ngoing to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>\n<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the\nthroat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy\nand life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a\npermanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination\ndidn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer\nGeorge Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or\nfour days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in\nit, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to\nreally have that</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to\ntreat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either\nscribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward\ncomputer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>\n<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to\nFacebook, and blogging at <a href=\"http://rogerebert.com/\">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped\nout posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about\neverything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak\n’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his\ninevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,\nand he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with\nthe world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Steal Like an Artist - Austin Kleon</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oww7oB9rjgw\">Steal Like An Artist: Austin Kleon at TEDxKC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/WMc3yh4Buvk\">Keep Going with Austin Kleon and Debbie Millman | SXSW 2019</a></li>\n<li>Brian Eno, A Year With Swollen Appendices</li>\n<li>Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From</li>\n<li>David Byrne, How Music Works</li>\n<li>Mike Monteiro, Design Is a Job</li>\n<li>Kio Stark, Don’t Go Back to School</li>\n<li>Ian Svenonius, Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock ‘n’ Roll</li>\n<li>Sidney Lumet, Making Movies</li>\n<li>P.T.

Contact every three weeks.</li>\n<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>\n<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>\n<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have\ntheir correct info.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Normal World &amp; Business World\n<ul>\n<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they\ndon’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a\ntotal loser.</li>\n<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,\nyou’re a loser!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to be cool?\n<ul>\n<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal\nboring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had\nthe courage.</li>\n<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but\nit’s considerate and part of your art.</li>\n<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only\ngreat at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>\n<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them\ncurious.</li>\n<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme\ncharacter. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About People\n<ul>\n<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>\n<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a\nfriend. That’s how things are done</li>\n<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that\nthing is popular.</li>\n<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with\nyour existing contacts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Business\n<ul>\n<li>How beat competitor?\n<ul>\n<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>\n<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>\n<li>Play a completely different game.</li>\n<li>Be radically opposite</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters\n<ul>\n<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.\nMake sure they stick together as a group.</li>\n<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not\nyourself. Make it fun to join.</li>\n<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are\nhaving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been\ndone.\n<ul>\n<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use\nAmazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not\nbe able to imagine that niche without you.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your\nattention</li>\n<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that\nit’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>\n<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>\n<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,\ncompetition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,\nbeing a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that\nyou’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate\nto you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>\n<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

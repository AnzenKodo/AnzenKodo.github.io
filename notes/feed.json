      "content_html": "<h1>Your Music and People</h1>\n<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 9:01 PM Page No.: 146\nProgress: ✔️</p>\n<p>A philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate,\nresourceful, and connected.</p>\n<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make database of people &amp; and how often I should contact them.</li>\n<li>Build some persona for people to look up to.</li>\n<li>Never give to I am contacting someone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Points</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Socialize\n<ul>\n<li>How to use friends database?\n<ul>\n<li>Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.</li>\n<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>\n<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>\n<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have\ntheir correct info.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Normal World &amp; Business World\n<ul>\n<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they\ndon’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a\ntotal loser.</li>\n<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,\nyou’re a loser!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to be cool?\n<ul>\n<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal\nboring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had\nthe courage.</li>\n<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but\nit’s considerate and part of your art.</li>\n<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only\ngreat at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>\n<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them\ncurious.</li>\n<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme\ncharacter. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About People\n<ul>\n<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>\n<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a\nfriend. That’s how things are done</li>\n<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that\nthing is popular.</li>\n<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with\nyour existing contacts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Business\n<ul>\n<li>How beat competitor?\n<ul>\n<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>\n<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>\n<li>Play a completely different game.</li>\n<li>Be radically opposite</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters\n<ul>\n<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.\nMake sure they stick together as a group.</li>\n<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not\nyourself. Make it fun to join.</li>\n<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are\nhaving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been\ndone.\n<ul>\n<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use\nAmazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not\nbe able to imagine that niche without you.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your\nattention</li>\n<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that\nit’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>\n<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>\n<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,\ncompetition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,\nbeing a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that\nyou’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate\nto you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>\n<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

      "content_html": "<h1>Hell Yeah or No</h1>\n<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 7:14 PM Page No.: 132\nProgress: ✔️</p>\n<p>A collection of thoughts around re-defining yourself, changing focus, and saying\nyes to less</p>\n<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus more on my global friends.</li>\n<li>Start comparing to my old self not other people.</li>\n<li>Start saying everything is my responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Points</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Business points\n<ul>\n<li>Local Vs Global\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re local, you focus on your community, doing things in-person. But\nthis means you have less time to focus on the rest of the world.</li>\n<li>If you’re global, you make things for the whole world. But this means you\nhave less time to be part of your local community.</li>\n<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t\nsee it until we get outside of it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Job Vs Art\n<ul>\n<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing\nsatisfy your entire life.\n<ul>\n<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid\nstability for part of your day, but then need creative time for\nexpression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art\nto the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then\nlong for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid\nfuture. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when\nfactoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a\nfew years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a\nhead choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job\nyour entire life.</li>\n<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.\nKeep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to get inspiration?\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>\n<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to start?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>\n<li>If you love something copy it. Nothing is OG.</li>\n<li>You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.</li>\n<li>Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal\nservice. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What don’t do?\n<ul>\n<li>Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action. But\nsuccess comes from doing, not declaring.</li>\n<li>Use title if you are really doing that.</li>\n<li>Don’t announce anything.</li>\n<li>Don’t choose a name.</li>\n<li>Don’t make a website or an app.</li>\n<li>Don’t build a system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What comes with business?\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t do everything you have prioritize somethings only.</li>\n<li>To make money you have to let go your freedom.</li>\n<li>Be honest to yourself what you want to pursue.</li>\n<li>But when you go against the stereotype, people get confused. Ex: <strong>The\nentrepreneur who’s not into money.</strong></li>\n<li>You first action wasn’t most honest but it’s answer that you came up\ninstead of thinking deep.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Socialize\n<ul>\n<li>Little steps can make lot of difference.</li>\n<li>Avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate you. They’re not allowed in my life\nright now, not even for a minute. No big explanation needed. No compromise.\nNo favors.</li>\n<li>Like blocking this things: Social media comments, Distracting environments,\nDiscouraging family members &amp; Your email inbox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of decisions\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three things to consider when making life-size decisions.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>What makes you happy</li>\n<li>What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you</li>\n<li>What’s useful to others</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Smart and useful (but not happy)\n<ul>\n<li>Smart and useful isn’t bad. It’s rational, like a machine. But happiness\nis the oil. Without it, the friction kills the engine.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the strict parent who says, “You will go to the\nbest school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make\nlots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you\nand your family.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and smart (but not useful)\n<ul>\n<li>They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something\nthat’s really valuable to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:\nalways learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be\nhappy and create the perfect life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and useful (but not smart)\n<ul>\n<li>But if a graduate’s time could be worth 200 per hour, yet they’re doing\nwork that locals could do better for10 per hour (and without airfare and\nhotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of charity volunteers. After getting expensive\nuniversity degrees, they spend years flying to exotic impoverished places\nto dig wells and thatch roofs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Points\n<ul>\n<li>How to learn?\n<ul>\n<li>Learning without doing is wasted.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do change your mindset?\n<ul>\n<li>Doubt what I know. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. Require current\nproof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed. What got me\nhere won’t get me there.</li>\n<li>Old ways don’t work anymore. You have to change see beyond your tunnel\nview. Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.\nIf you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and\nno responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever\nelse, you need to realize it and embrace it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could\nchange your mind soon.\n<ul>\n<li>I have to smile, thinking about what my former self would say. But the\nformer self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions\nas if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just\nthe result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t\ndefine who we are in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the\nnext-lower one.\n<ul>\n<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get\nit, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that\nsilver envy. Instead, if you aim to buy the “good enough” thing, it will\nkeep you in the bronze mindset. Since you’re not comparing to the best,\nyou’ll feel no need to keep up.</li>\n<li>Trying to be the best at a specific skill, it’s good to be dissatisfied.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ego\n<ul>\n<li>Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.</li>\n<li>I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at\nall.</li>\n<li>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Smart &amp; Stupid\n<ul>\n<li>Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to find the\nreal answer, <strong>not the easiest answer.</strong></li>\n<li>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. <strong>Jumping\nto a conclusion is like quitting a game.</strong> You lose by default.</li>\n<li>So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped\nthinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to overcome comfort zone?\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re scared to talk to someone intimidating. You notice you’re\nscared. Whatever scares you, go do it.</li>\n<li>Once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore! As\nyou go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and\nless in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Think you are below average.\n<ul>\n<li>Thing people get wrong.\n<ul>\n<li>Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than\nthe average cancer patient.</li>\n<li>Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average\nteachers.</li>\n<li>Ninety percent of students think they are more intelligent than the\naverage student.</li>\n<li>Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Assume I’m below average.</li>\n<li>It serves well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped\nthinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Thing it is your fault.\n<ul>\n<li>When you forgive, you’re still assuming that they’re wrong and you’re the\nvictim.</li>\n<li>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged.</li>\n<li>People were just playing their part in the situation you helped create.</li>\n<li>Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can\nlearn from it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Productivity\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Step to improve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That one little action changes how you think about yourself.</li>\n<li>Having taken that one step, you start to think of yourself as brave, or an\nachiever, or a bit of an expert on a subject.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel generous, so you start to act\ngenerous, so you become generous.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel like a leader, so you start to\nact like a leader, so you become a leader.</li>\n<li>The world treats you as you treat yourself. Your actions show the world\nwho you are.</li>\n<li>You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So\nstart by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already. You\nwouldn’t wait. Nothing would stop you.</li>\n<li>The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. The future doesn’t\nexist.</li>\n<li>Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment</li>\n<li>You have to optimize for one main goal and have to let go others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If they really wanted to do it, they would have done it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.</li>\n<li>Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Present-focused people &amp; Future-focused people.</p>\n<p><strong>Present-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty</li>\n<li>Focus on immediate gratification</li>\n<li>Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them</li>\n<li>Are playful, impulsive, and sensual</li>\n<li>Avoid anything boring, difficult, or repetitive</li>\n<li>Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time</li>\n<li>Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol</li>\n<li>Are better at helping others than helping themselves</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Future-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delay gratification</li>\n<li>Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future\ngoals</li>\n<li>Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and\npossible futures</li>\n<li>Especially love their work</li>\n<li>Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams</li>\n<li>Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others</li>\n<li>Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the\nexpense of personal relationships, which require a present focus</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No &amp; Yes</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s an easier decision.

Jumping to a\nconclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart</strong> - It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Long term</strong> - Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years,\nthen another.</p>\n<p><strong>Short term</strong> - assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t\nhappen.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>One day, I wrote a blog post sharing what I had learned while switching between\nthe PHP programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. At the time, my blog\nhad no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the\nrecord.</p>\n<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,\nand it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand\ncomments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>\n<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,\nsomething switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They\nweren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked\nlike me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they\nhad never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,\nbecause they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and\nspewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was\nfunny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the\nspotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some\nfamous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The\nrichest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve\noptimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take\nless money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that\ndeal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,\nentirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t\nsocialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business\ngrow quickly.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —\nsuper productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in\nPortland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused\nglobally.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to\nget fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every\nrequest, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent\nmost of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and\nunfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two\nhours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole\nworld, including that one person.</p>\n<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new\narticles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>\n<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my\ncommunity, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old\ncompany had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.\nCustomers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they\nwished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It\ntook me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients\na favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most\nsuccessful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8\nmillion for thousands of musicians.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Time Paradox — Philip Zimbardo</li>\n<li>Turning Pro — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>The Resistance — Gemma Malley</li>\n<li>The War of Art — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Do the Work — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Ego is the Enemy — Ryan Holiday</li>\n<li>Forever Nomad — Tynan, Rolf Potts, Derek Sivers, Leo Babauta, and Todd Iceton</li>\n<li>Positioning — Al Ries and Jack Trout</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://brightthemag.com/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d\">The Reductive Seduction Of Other People’s Problems</a></p>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Art is useless by definition.

The\nindividuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular\narea, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.\n<ul>\n<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and\nchallenging tasks.</li>\n<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural\nfit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the\ncompany’s values and norms.\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees\nand to the organization.</li>\n<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in\nthe organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the\nmission.</li>\n<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms\nwas zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>\n<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>\n<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model\nand more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>\n<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower\nthan star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>\n<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or\nintegrating a diverse workforce.</li>\n<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too\ninsular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and\nthey’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.\nAs a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more\nreliable financial results than their competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their\nperspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of\ndissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from\npeople who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>\n<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times\nhigher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the\nfounder’s original model.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of\nthe firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on\npotential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>\n<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the\nfounder.</li>\n<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with\ncommitment blueprints.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who\nreinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers\nthrow culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates\ncan improve the culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles\nagainst it than in support of it.</li>\n<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>\n<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the\nprinciples. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>\n<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on\ndifferent values or interpret the same values differently.</li>\n<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and\n<strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act\nin the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear\nof failing.</li>\n<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be\ncrippled by fear.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and\nconvert it into motivation.</li>\n<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering\nevery relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables\nthem to feel a sense of control.</li>\n<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the\ndifficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>\n<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature\npositive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic\nproduct decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too\noptimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention\nto potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to\ntake preventative and corrective actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more\nterrifying than the negative.</li>\n<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>\n<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re\nnot alone.</li>\n<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>\n<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to\nemphasize losses rather than gains.</li>\n<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with\nthe present.</li>\n<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation\nor revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better\nsystem. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>\n<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the\nfirst place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by\npeople, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to\nconsider how they can be improved.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>\n<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is\nincomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or\nwriting process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give\nideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>\n<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,\nand you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s\nalso tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they\nevaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by\npeers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>\n<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from\nLisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to\nspend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of\nbusiness</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.\nThen, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert\nthem into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>\n<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a\nmonthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones\nare worth solving.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do\nyou think this made her feel?”.</li>\n<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Story</h1>\n<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href=\"http://dosomething.org/\">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO\nNancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,\nbecause they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.\nEmployees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have\nto explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because\nthe title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to\ncontribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just\nthirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of\nspeaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for\ndelivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades\ntesting out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the\nthousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different\nmelodies and refrains.</p>\n<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a\nseries of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to\nexplain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.\nExplaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to\nexplain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.\nConsidering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize\nthat some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to\nencourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David\nHofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a\nsignificant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical\nprofessionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent\nmore soap and gel</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their\nearly thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,\nthe vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,\npsychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments\nto changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a\nmajor influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations\nto drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been\ninfluenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their\nmentors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse\nworkforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the\nnavy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he\ndidn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took\non; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and\ndedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same\npassions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and\ncohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your\norganization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever\nencountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.\nHeadquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in\ninvestments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its\nphilosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the\nfounder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a\nword about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any\nsituation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful\nwork and build meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees\nare hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating\nthat’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp\nmodeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the\nprinciples, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and\nevaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s\nalways a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,\nto the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for\nemployees to stay for decades.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,\nbut its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,\nboth of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.\nThey’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in\nthe history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the\ncombined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the\nSteve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone\nspecial. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a\nmeeting with an important potential client:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50\nminutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all\nbecause there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the\noutset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a\n“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who\nattended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A\nto F.</p>\n<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be\nfired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the\ncountry’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,\nthey are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance\nby turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon\nthey saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to\nstart driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,\npedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars\nand trucks at a glacial pace.</p>\n<h1>Questions</h1>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passionate people don’t wear their passion on their sleeves; they have it in\ntheir hearts. – Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They don’t wait for permission to start building something.

That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day.

And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew.

Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would\ndo a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your\npoem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?\nIt’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and\nsay, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your\nlife worth?”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of\nthe International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family\nwere sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate\ninterest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced\nmajor budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help\npeople connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said\nHadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day\nactivities.”</p>\n<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>\n<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him\nset up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,\nwhile performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered\nquestions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded\nmusic, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his\nteeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions\nof people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t\nnormally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN\nSPACE!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided\n“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to\ndirect Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he\nwas held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to\ndie,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .\n. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m\ngoing to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>\n<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the\nthroat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy\nand life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a\npermanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination\ndidn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer\nGeorge Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or\nfour days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in\nit, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to\nreally have that</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to\ntreat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either\nscribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward\ncomputer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>\n<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to\nFacebook, and blogging at <a href=\"http://rogerebert.com/\">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped\nout posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about\neverything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak\n’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his\ninevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,\nand he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with\nthe world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Steal Like an Artist - Austin Kleon</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oww7oB9rjgw\">Steal Like An Artist: Austin Kleon at TEDxKC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/WMc3yh4Buvk\">Keep Going with Austin Kleon and Debbie Millman | SXSW 2019</a></li>\n<li>Brian Eno, A Year With Swollen Appendices</li>\n<li>Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From</li>\n<li>David Byrne, How Music Works</li>\n<li>Mike Monteiro, Design Is a Job</li>\n<li>Kio Stark, Don’t Go Back to School</li>\n<li>Ian Svenonius, Supernatural Strategies for Making a Rock ‘n’ Roll</li>\n<li>Sidney Lumet, Making Movies</li>\n<li>P.T.

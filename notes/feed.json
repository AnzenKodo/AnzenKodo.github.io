Contact every three weeks.</li>\n<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>\n<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>\n<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have\ntheir correct info.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Normal World &amp; Business World\n<ul>\n<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they\ndon’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a\ntotal loser.</li>\n<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,\nyou’re a loser!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to be cool?\n<ul>\n<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal\nboring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had\nthe courage.</li>\n<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but\nit’s considerate and part of your art.</li>\n<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only\ngreat at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>\n<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them\ncurious.</li>\n<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme\ncharacter. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About People\n<ul>\n<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>\n<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a\nfriend. That’s how things are done</li>\n<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that\nthing is popular.</li>\n<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with\nyour existing contacts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Business\n<ul>\n<li>How beat competitor?\n<ul>\n<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>\n<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>\n<li>Play a completely different game.</li>\n<li>Be radically opposite</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters\n<ul>\n<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.\nMake sure they stick together as a group.</li>\n<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not\nyourself. Make it fun to join.</li>\n<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are\nhaving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been\ndone.\n<ul>\n<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use\nAmazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not\nbe able to imagine that niche without you.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your\nattention</li>\n<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that\nit’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>\n<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>\n<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,\ncompetition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,\nbeing a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that\nyou’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate\nto you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>\n<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then.

But our purpose should be sought not merely through what feels\ngood. It must be considered and reasoned. We must accumulate evidence\nsupporting it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Constructive</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>This is money for why what you value is often not as important as why you\nvalue it. If you value martial arts because you enjoy hurting people, then\nthat’s a bad value. But if you value it because you are in the military and\nwant to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.Controllable</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.\nCreativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because\nyou CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a\nside effect.</li>\n<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,\nstanding up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>\n<h3>Bad values are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Emotion-based</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions\nand are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge\nor information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are\ngenerally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term\ngains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Destructive</li>\n<li>Uncontrollable</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up\nyour life to that thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,\nfeeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being\nalone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,\nsacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>\n<h3>How to change values?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into\nvaluing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite\neffect—they double down).</li>\n<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes\nthis contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.\nToo much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>\n<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The world sucks</li>\n<li>We suck</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of\ntrying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a\nfew. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving\nyour best effort.</li>\n<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always\nneed more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will\nneed more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need\nless money.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control\nwhether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You\ncan always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always\ncontrol if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something\nyou find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>\n<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings\nor even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>\n<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every\naspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with\nyour father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for\nrespect.\n<ul>\n<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>\n<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.\n<ul>\n<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an\nadult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>\n<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,\nbecause to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you\nare obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fault</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to\nmake them perfect too.</li>\n<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>\n<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter\nwhose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big\nhole, start climbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>\n<h3>FAIL</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad\nlong-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.\n<ul>\n<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not\ndoing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where\npursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is\nintrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>\n<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who\ndon’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life\nplans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up\na mountain for a molehill.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right\nreasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to\nnever love at all.</li>\n</ul>",

The fall from the middle to low is\ndevastating.</li>\n<li>Research shows that the mistakes we regret are not errors of commission, But\nerrors of omission.</li>\n<li>Pioneers and Settlers</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The pioneers were first movers the initial company to develop or sell a\nproduct.\n<ul>\n<li>47 percent of the failure rate.</li>\n<li>10% of the market share.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The settlers were slower to launch, waiting until the pioneers had c treated a\nmarket before entering.\n<ul>\n<li>8 percent of the failure rate.</li>\n<li>22% of the market share.</li>\n<li>Settlers are often branded as copycats, but this stereotype misses the mark.\nInstead of conforming to the existing demand, they bide their time until\nthey’re ready to introduce something new. Slow to enter because they’re\nworking on revolutionary products, services, or technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of\nevery four fail because of premature scaling—<strong>making investments that the\nmarket isn’t yet ready to support</strong>.</li>\n<li>The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to\nrush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.</li>\n<li>Conceptual &amp; Experimental innovators</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.</li>\n<li>Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.</li>\n<li>Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk\ncopying, themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and\nevolving as they go along.\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.</li>\n<li>45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.</li>\n<li>The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: <strong>instead\nof reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering\nnew one’s</strong>.</li>\n<li>:eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate\nexpertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas\nfrom the past.</strong> Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your\nimagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your\nperipheral vision.</li>\n<li>The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more\nstrongly you identify with an extreme group, <strong>the harder you seek to\ndifferentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values</strong>.</li>\n<li>Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. <strong>When the overlap in\ntactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less\nlikely</strong>. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have\nless to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be\nredundant.</li>\n<li>You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing\nsomething original that challenges the status quo.</li>\n<li>Negative &amp; Ambivalent Relationship</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague\nconsistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.</li>\n<li>Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions\nabout when that person can actually be trusted.\n<ul>\n<li>Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative\nrelationships.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re\nthe ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet\nagain, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.</li>\n<li>People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started\nout negative and then become more positive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince\nthem to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing\ntheirs.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our\nagendas to familiar values that people already hold.</strong></li>\n<li>As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals\noccasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to\nattempt to steal a base.</li>\n<li>Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns\nbelieved in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.</li>\n<li>An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old\nfirstborn.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often\ncoincides with societal expectations.</li>\n<li>Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a\ncheater.”</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person\nin the mirror.</li>\n<li>But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality\nis tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of\nMeena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of <strong>Martin Luther King,\nJr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela</strong>.</li>\n<li>Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star,\nand commitment.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills:\nFounders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or\nscientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.\n<ul>\n<li>Failure rates we’re were worse.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future\npotential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The\nindividuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular\narea, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.\n<ul>\n<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and\nchallenging tasks.</li>\n<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural\nfit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the\ncompany’s values and norms.\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees\nand to the organization.</li>\n<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in\nthe organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the\nmission.</li>\n<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms\nwas zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>\n<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>\n<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model\nand more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>\n<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower\nthan star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>\n<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or\nintegrating a diverse workforce.</li>\n<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too\ninsular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and\nthey’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.\nAs a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more\nreliable financial results than their competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their\nperspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of\ndissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from\npeople who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>\n<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times\nhigher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the\nfounder’s original model.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of\nthe firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on\npotential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>\n<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the\nfounder.</li>\n<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with\ncommitment blueprints.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who\nreinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers\nthrow culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates\ncan improve the culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles\nagainst it than in support of it.</li>\n<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>\n<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the\nprinciples. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>\n<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on\ndifferent values or interpret the same values differently.</li>\n<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and\n<strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act\nin the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear\nof failing.</li>\n<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be\ncrippled by fear.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and\nconvert it into motivation.</li>\n<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering\nevery relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables\nthem to feel a sense of control.</li>\n<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the\ndifficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>\n<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature\npositive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic\nproduct decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too\noptimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention\nto potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to\ntake preventative and corrective actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more\nterrifying than the negative.</li>\n<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>\n<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re\nnot alone.</li>\n<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>\n<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to\nemphasize losses rather than gains.</li>\n<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with\nthe present.</li>\n<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation\nor revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better\nsystem. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>\n<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the\nfirst place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by\npeople, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to\nconsider how they can be improved.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>\n<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is\nincomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or\nwriting process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give\nideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>\n<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,\nand you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s\nalso tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they\nevaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by\npeers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>\n<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from\nLisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to\nspend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of\nbusiness</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.\nThen, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert\nthem into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>\n<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a\nmonthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones\nare worth solving.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do\nyou think this made her feel?”.</li>\n<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Story</h1>\n<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href=\"http://dosomething.org/\">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO\nNancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,\nbecause they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.\nEmployees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have\nto explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because\nthe title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to\ncontribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just\nthirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of\nspeaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for\ndelivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades\ntesting out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the\nthousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different\nmelodies and refrains.</p>\n<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a\nseries of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to\nexplain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.\nExplaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to\nexplain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.\nConsidering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize\nthat some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to\nencourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David\nHofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a\nsignificant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical\nprofessionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent\nmore soap and gel</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their\nearly thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,\nthe vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,\npsychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments\nto changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a\nmajor influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations\nto drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been\ninfluenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their\nmentors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse\nworkforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the\nnavy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he\ndidn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took\non; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and\ndedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same\npassions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and\ncohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your\norganization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever\nencountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.\nHeadquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in\ninvestments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its\nphilosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the\nfounder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a\nword about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any\nsituation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful\nwork and build meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees\nare hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating\nthat’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp\nmodeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the\nprinciples, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and\nevaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s\nalways a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,\nto the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for\nemployees to stay for decades.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,\nbut its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,\nboth of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.\nThey’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in\nthe history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the\ncombined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the\nSteve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone\nspecial. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a\nmeeting with an important potential client:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50\nminutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all\nbecause there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the\noutset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a\n“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who\nattended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A\nto F.</p>\n<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be\nfired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the\ncountry’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,\nthey are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance\nby turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon\nthey saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to\nstart driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,\npedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars\nand trucks at a glacial pace.</p>\n<h1>Questions</h1>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passionate people don’t wear their passion on their sleeves; they have it in\ntheir hearts. – Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They don’t wait for permission to start building something.

For the extreme\ntakers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of\nevery ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four\nwere about themselves alone and no one else.</li>\n<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in\ntheir companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt\nentitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>\n<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms\n<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total\nshareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger\nlosses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung\nfor the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and\nlarger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.\nSometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put\ntheir companies in jeopardy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97\">Giver and Taker</a> On the left\nside is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about\nme.

Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form\nof punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker\ntendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as\n<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning\nbridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Storys</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored\nwith an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his\ncomputer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech\nserver. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music.

Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark\nugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all\nthe awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part\nof you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,\nrather than against it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>\n<li>You pursue it rather than run from it.

They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X\namount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>\n<li>Habits are an investing mindset.

He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know\nhow he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too\noverwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey\nman, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed\nby a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off\nwith a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for\ngood measure.</li>\n<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew.

He tells childhood stories about\nvacuuming and cleaning up after his siblings. When he sold his first book, he\nwas cleaning houses in Manhattan. Now he’s a rich bestselling author and lives\nin a village west of London. Do you know how he spends most of his day? Picking\nup trash on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>That’s right: One of our most popular living authors estimates that he a garbage\ntruck after him: “Pig Pen Sedaris.” He’s best known to his neighbors as a litter\npicker. When the West Sussex County Times wrote about him, they didn’t even\nmention he was a writer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Twenty-Four Hours a Day - Richmond Walker</li>\n<li>The Gift - Lewis Hyde</li>\n<li>Daily Rituals - Mason Currey</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it\nmakes me happy just to do it . . . I think trying to be creative, keeping\nbusy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Willie Nelson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“None of us know what will happen. Don’t spend time worrying about it. Make\nthe most beautiful thing you can. Try to do that every day. That’s it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Laurie Anderson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Annie Dillard</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Relying on craft and routine is a lot less sexy than being an artistic\ngenius. But it is an excellent strategy for not going insane.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Christoph Niemann</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Your list is your past and your future. Carry at all times. Prioritize:\ntoday, this week, and eventually. You will someday die with items still on\nyour list, but for now, while you live, your list helps prioritize what can be\ndone in your limited time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Tom Sachs</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The greatest need of our time is to clean out the enormous mass of mental and\nemotional rubbish that clutters our minds and makes of all political and\nsocial life a mass illness. Without this housecleaning, we cannot begin to\nsee. Unless we see, we cannot think.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Thomas Merton</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common\nsense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Gertrude Stein</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Keep your eye on your inner world and keep away from ads and idiots and movie\nstars.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Dorothea Tanning</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I paint with my back to the world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Agnes Martin</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You have to have done something before you can be said to have done\nsomething. The title of artist or architect or musician needs to somehow be\nearned.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Dave Hickey</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are only responsible for your work so DO IT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Sol LeWitt to Eva Hesse</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No artist can work simply for results; he must also like the work of getting\nthem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Robert Farrar Capon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Don’t make stuff because you want to make money—it will never make you enough\nmoney. And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous—because you will\nnever feel famous enough. Make gifts for people—and work hard on making those\ngifts in the hope that those people will notice and like the gifts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—John Green</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What I’m really concerned about is reaching one person.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Jorge Luis Borges</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s as true today as it ever was: He who seeks beauty will find it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Bill Cunningham</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Drawing is the discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world. I have\nlearned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen, and that when I\nstart drawing an ordinary thing, I realize how extraordinary it is, sheer\nmiracle.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Frederick Franck</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“For anyone trying to discern what to do with their life: PAY ATTENTION TO\nWHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO. That’s pretty much all the info you need.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Amy Krouse Rosenthal</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Tell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—José Ortega y Gassett</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I am for an art that helps old ladies across the street.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Claes Oldenburg</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed\nideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.\nOne should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be\ndetermined to make them otherwise.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The artist’s natural state is one of not-knowing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Donald Barthelme</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths\nand specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the\nbooks that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And\nthat means the old books . . . To be sure, the books of the future would be\njust as good a corrective as the books of the past, but unfortunately we\ncannot get at them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—C. S. Lewis</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Things that belong together have been taken apart. And you can’t put it all\nback together again. What you can do is the only thing that you can do. You\ntake two things that ought to be together and you put them together.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Wendell Berry</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Go out and walk. That is the glory of life.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Maira Kalman</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Imitate the trees. Learn to lose in order to recover, and remember that\nnothing stays the same for long.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—May Sarton</p>",

Are you self-employed or is this client your boss?</li>\n<li>If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.</li>\n<li>By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose wants.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good thing about small clients.\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t need to change what you do to please one client; you need to please only the majority (or yourself).</li>\n<li>If one client needs to leave, it’s OK; you can sincerely wish her well.</li>\n<li>Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).</li>\n<li>You hear hundreds of people’s opinions and stay in touch with what the majority of your clients want.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes happy &amp; fulfilling.</li>\n<li>When you are at something great you don’t feel something big going to happen.</li>\n<li>You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.</li>\n<li>Business improvement.\n<ul>\n<li>Customers satisfaction.\n<ul>\n<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</li>\n<li>Make every decision even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone according to what’s best for your customers.</li>\n<li>If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Important things to remember.\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t let other people play with your fear. Like Saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios. Those are just sales tactics.</li>\n<li>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</li>\n<li>Don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>\n<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. <strong>It’s a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.</strong></li>\n<li>You don’t need something big to improve the business sometimes it’s little things that’s add up.</li>\n<li>People remember you more for the smile that you put on there face then fancy business stuff.</li>\n<li>Always prepare for 2x because anytime it can come.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self-Employed VS Business Owner\n<ul>\n<li>Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles.</li>\n<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Solve problems\n<ul>\n<li>Before trusting someone verify that they can do the job.</li>\n<li>Why businesses keep problems around? (Like- Nord VPN)\n→A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.</li>\n<li>If the company has a problem with your decisions then explain your thought process and philosophy.</li>\n<li>If you are an owner of the company you can be anything. And if don’t feel like doing something then give the role to someone who loves doing that role.</li>\n<li>Don’t freedom but don’t give too much that they can overturn you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start now. No funding needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Personal improvement.\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t follow other people path without making your own path.</li>\n<li>Don’t spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them you should want.</li>\n<li>If present is worse than past, then move back and restart improving where things are good.</li>\n<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.</li>\n<li>Doing work yourself is inefficient but it is what make it so joyful in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Derek Sivers philosophies of Business.\n<ul>\n<li>Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.</li>\n<li>Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.</li>\n<li>When you make a company, you make a utopia. It’s where you design your perfect world.</li>\n<li>Never do anything just for the money.</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</li>\n<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.</li>\n<li>Your business plan is moot. You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.</li>\n<li>Starting with no money is an advantage. You don’t need money to start helping people.</li>\n<li>You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.</li>\n<li>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</li>\n<li>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abdicate</strong> - Surrender or relinquish power or responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterward and the whole party marched down the 6th.

Each one is somebody who got the email and loved it enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers. When you’re thinking of how to make your business</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We answered our phone within two rings, always 7am to 10pm, seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m a student, not a guru.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it’s not a hit, switch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No business plan survives first contact with customers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steve Blank:</p>",

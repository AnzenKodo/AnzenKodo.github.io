He tells childhood stories about\nvacuuming and cleaning up after his siblings. When he sold his first book, he\nwas cleaning houses in Manhattan. Now he’s a rich bestselling author and lives\nin a village west of London. Do you know how he spends most of his day? Picking\nup trash on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>That’s right: One of our most popular living authors estimates that he a garbage\ntruck after him: “Pig Pen Sedaris.” He’s best known to his neighbors as a litter\npicker. When the West Sussex County Times wrote about him, they didn’t even\nmention he was a writer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Twenty-Four Hours a Day - Richmond Walker</li>\n<li>The Gift - Lewis Hyde</li>\n<li>Daily Rituals - Mason Currey</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it\nmakes me happy just to do it . . . I think trying to be creative, keeping\nbusy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Willie Nelson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“None of us know what will happen. Don’t spend time worrying about it. Make\nthe most beautiful thing you can. Try to do that every day. That’s it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Laurie Anderson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Annie Dillard</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Relying on craft and routine is a lot less sexy than being an artistic\ngenius. But it is an excellent strategy for not going insane.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Christoph Niemann</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Your list is your past and your future. Carry at all times. Prioritize:\ntoday, this week, and eventually. You will someday die with items still on\nyour list, but for now, while you live, your list helps prioritize what can be\ndone in your limited time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Tom Sachs</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The greatest need of our time is to clean out the enormous mass of mental and\nemotional rubbish that clutters our minds and makes of all political and\nsocial life a mass illness. Without this housecleaning, we cannot begin to\nsee. Unless we see, we cannot think.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Thomas Merton</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common\nsense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Gertrude Stein</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Keep your eye on your inner world and keep away from ads and idiots and movie\nstars.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Dorothea Tanning</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I paint with my back to the world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Agnes Martin</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You have to have done something before you can be said to have done\nsomething. The title of artist or architect or musician needs to somehow be\nearned.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Dave Hickey</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are only responsible for your work so DO IT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Sol LeWitt to Eva Hesse</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No artist can work simply for results; he must also like the work of getting\nthem.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Robert Farrar Capon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Don’t make stuff because you want to make money—it will never make you enough\nmoney. And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous—because you will\nnever feel famous enough. Make gifts for people—and work hard on making those\ngifts in the hope that those people will notice and like the gifts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—John Green</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What I’m really concerned about is reaching one person.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Jorge Luis Borges</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s as true today as it ever was: He who seeks beauty will find it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Bill Cunningham</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Drawing is the discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world. I have\nlearned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen, and that when I\nstart drawing an ordinary thing, I realize how extraordinary it is, sheer\nmiracle.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Frederick Franck</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“For anyone trying to discern what to do with their life: PAY ATTENTION TO\nWHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO.

Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark\nugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all\nthe awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part\nof you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,\nrather than against it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>\n<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get\nstronger and healthier and happier.</li>\n<li>Goal vs Habits\n<ul>\n<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X\namount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>\n<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one’s efforts\nfor a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest\nthem in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>\n<li>People don’t develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is\ndifferent.</li>\n<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,\nmake other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.\n<ul>\n<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some\nform of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone\nto quit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You wouldn’t keep watching a TV show you don’t like. You wouldn’t eat an\nentire plate of food you don’t like. So why the hell are you trying to read a\nbook you don’t like?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stores</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Waight Loss\n<ul>\n<li>I know someone who lost a lot of weight (almost 80 lbs) over a 2-year\nperiod. He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know\nhow he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too\noverwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey\nman, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed\nby a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off\nwith a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for\ngood measure.</li>\n<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting\nsomebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Contact once a year, to make sure you still have\ntheir correct info.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Normal World &amp; Business World\n<ul>\n<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they\ndon’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a\ntotal loser.</li>\n<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,\nyou’re a loser!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to be cool?\n<ul>\n<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal\nboring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had\nthe courage.</li>\n<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but\nit’s considerate and part of your art.</li>\n<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only\ngreat at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>\n<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them\ncurious.</li>\n<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme\ncharacter. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About People\n<ul>\n<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>\n<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a\nfriend.

Publicize the group, not\nyourself. Make it fun to join.</li>\n<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are\nhaving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels.

It’s more useful to assume that\nit’s all up to you.

If people give you money, it’s proof that\nyou’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate\nto you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>\n<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

Colleges\nhave always been more liberal than the American population.</li>\n<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces\n(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and\nmanpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic\nhappens, and it fails to make the news.</li>\n<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared\nwith only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but\nwithout data, you would never know it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement of world\n<ul>\n<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more\nfortunate countries to 81.</li>\n<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>\n<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most\nliberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking\ncountries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist\ncountries of central Europe.</li>\n<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the\nidea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over\ntime.</li>\n<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th\ncentury, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car\naccident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99\npercent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall\nto their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less\nlikely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent\nless likely to be killed on the job.</li>\n<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human\nlife. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward\nmore mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life\nvirtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and\nthey constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that\nthis tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the\nstagnation of progress.</li>\n<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have\nvalues today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement in Lifestyle\n<ul>\n<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in\n2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the\nwashing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the\nIndustrial Revolution.</li>\n<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children\nthan stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>\n<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty\nrate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10\npercent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>\n<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier\nthan their helicoptering parents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human nature\n<ul>\n<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those\nwith meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>\n<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones\nmakes it more meaningful.</li>\n<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,\nstruggle, and worry.</li>\n<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are\nopened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely\nhuman cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past\nand stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of\nacquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability\nto persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and\nefficacy.</li>\n<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to\nthink it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and\nhelplessness.</li>\n<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor\nplummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out\nof desperation rather than greed.</li>\n<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>\n<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an\neffective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biases\n<ul>\n<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,\nto discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>\n<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with\nthe consequences of their opinions.</li>\n<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when\nthey are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are\nafter the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>\n<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as\nmuch as is feasible.</li>\n<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like\nit if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the\nother—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective\nmerits.</li>\n<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their\nbeliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you\nthan to pay attention to those who agree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social Media\n<ul>\n<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,\nfeel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>\n<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and\nthey empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their\nsuccesses.</li>\n<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely\nto want a large number of friend.</li>\n<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the\n1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,\nhave become any less social.</li>\n<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,\nunions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal\ngatherings and via digital media.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tech\n<ul>\n<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed\nto weaponize it.</li>\n<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work\nto defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>\n<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into\npreventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of\nyears of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of\nbiology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Countries\n<ul>\n<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and\nregulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western\nEurope) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to\nlive, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human\nflourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,\nand happiness.</li>\n<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries\nhave gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get\nhappier still.</li>\n<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in\nliberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market\nfreedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>\n<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but\nwhat about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in\nboring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without\nviolence?

To be a progressive, you have to have trust, because you believe that your worldview accurately reflects the real world—as experienced not just by your own small eyes, but by humanity as a whole.</p>\n<p>None of them hates Washington as a whole. So they can never unite to destroy it, and the whole machine is stable. See how beautiful this is? By separating voters into two competing but cooperating parties, neither of which can destroy the other, the two-party system creates a government which will survive indefinitely, no matter how much happier its citizens might be without it.</p>\n<h2>Sentences</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And the world changed. Before the 1960s, colonial governments and companies fought malaria because their officials often lived in remote outposts like Nigeria’s hill stations and Vietnam’s Marble Mountains. Independence movements led to freedom, but also often to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care.</strong></p>\n<p>What we see here is that independence movements—which the writer clearly believes are a good thing—led to some very concrete and very, very awful results, in addition to this curious abstraction—freedom. Clearly, whatever freedom means in this particular context, it’s such a great positive that even when you add it to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care, the result still exceeds zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what does it mean for a government to be “free,” anyway? Is the government of North Korea “free?” What about ExxonMobil? Or the Democratic Party? I have a fairly good understanding of what it means for a human being to be “free.” When it comes to an organization, especially one which claims to be a “government,” I’m quite without a clue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If yes, then hire her; if not, it’s worth rolling the dice on the last applicant instead, since her odds of being above the 50th percentile are 50/50 by definition.

      "content_html": "<h1>Personal Values</h1>\n<p>Author: Mark Manson Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 50 Progress:\n✔️</p>\n<h2>Values</h2>\n<h3>Good values are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Evidence-based</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>That “cause” is often what we refer to as our “purpose” and finding it is one\nof the most important endeavors we can take to enhance our health and\nwell-being. But our purpose should be sought not merely through what feels\ngood. It must be considered and reasoned. We must accumulate evidence\nsupporting it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Constructive</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>This is money for why what you value is often not as important as why you\nvalue it. If you value martial arts because you enjoy hurting people, then\nthat’s a bad value. But if you value it because you are in the military and\nwant to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.Controllable</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.\nCreativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because\nyou CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a\nside effect.</li>\n<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,\nstanding up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>\n<h3>Bad values are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Emotion-based</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions\nand are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge\nor information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are\ngenerally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term\ngains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Destructive</li>\n<li>Uncontrollable</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up\nyour life to that thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,\nfeeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being\nalone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,\nsacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>\n<h3>How to change values?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into\nvaluing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite\neffect—they double down).</li>\n<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes\nthis contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.\nToo much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>\n<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The world sucks</li>\n<li>We suck</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of\ntrying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a\nfew. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving\nyour best effort.</li>\n<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always\nneed more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will\nneed more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need\nless money.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control\nwhether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You\ncan always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always\ncontrol if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something\nyou find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>\n<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings\nor even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>\n<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every\naspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with\nyour father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for\nrespect.\n<ul>\n<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>\n<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.\n<ul>\n<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an\nadult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>\n<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,\nbecause to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you\nare obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fault</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to\nmake them perfect too.</li>\n<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>\n<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter\nwhose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big\nhole, start climbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>\n<h3>FAIL</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad\nlong-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.\n<ul>\n<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not\ndoing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where\npursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is\nintrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>\n<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who\ndon’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life\nplans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up\na mountain for a molehill.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right\nreasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to\nnever love at all.</li>\n</ul>",

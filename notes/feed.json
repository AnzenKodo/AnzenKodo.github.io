      "content_html": "<h2>Points</h2>\n<p>There is one difference, though. To be a Catholic, you have to have faith, because no one has ever seen the Holy Ghost. To be a progressive, you have to have trust, because you believe that your worldview accurately reflects the real world—as experienced not just by your own small eyes, but by humanity as a whole.</p>\n<p>None of them hates Washington as a whole. So they can never unite to destroy it, and the whole machine is stable. See how beautiful this is? By separating voters into two competing but cooperating parties, neither of which can destroy the other, the two-party system creates a government which will survive indefinitely, no matter how much happier its citizens might be without it.</p>\n<h2>Sentences</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And the world changed. Before the 1960s, colonial governments and companies fought malaria because their officials often lived in remote outposts like Nigeria’s hill stations and Vietnam’s Marble Mountains. Independence movements led to freedom, but also often to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care.</strong></p>\n<p>What we see here is that independence movements—which the writer clearly believes are a good thing—led to some very concrete and very, very awful results, in addition to this curious abstraction—freedom. Clearly, whatever freedom means in this particular context, it’s such a great positive that even when you add it to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care, the result still exceeds zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what does it mean for a government to be “free,” anyway? Is the government of North Korea “free?” What about ExxonMobil? Or the Democratic Party? I have a fairly good understanding of what it means for a human being to be “free.” When it comes to an organization, especially one which claims to be a “government,” I’m quite without a clue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

      "content_html": "<h1>Hell Yeah or No</h1>\n<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 7:14 PM Page No.: 132\nProgress: ✔️</p>\n<p>A collection of thoughts around re-defining yourself, changing focus, and saying\nyes to less</p>\n<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus more on my global friends.</li>\n<li>Start comparing to my old self not other people.</li>\n<li>Start saying everything is my responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Points</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Business points\n<ul>\n<li>Local Vs Global\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re local, you focus on your community, doing things in-person. But\nthis means you have less time to focus on the rest of the world.</li>\n<li>If you’re global, you make things for the whole world. But this means you\nhave less time to be part of your local community.</li>\n<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t\nsee it until we get outside of it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Job Vs Art\n<ul>\n<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing\nsatisfy your entire life.\n<ul>\n<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid\nstability for part of your day, but then need creative time for\nexpression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art\nto the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then\nlong for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid\nfuture. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when\nfactoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a\nfew years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a\nhead choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job\nyour entire life.</li>\n<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.\nKeep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to get inspiration?\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>\n<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to start?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>\n<li>If you love something copy it. Nothing is OG.</li>\n<li>You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.</li>\n<li>Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal\nservice. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What don’t do?\n<ul>\n<li>Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action. But\nsuccess comes from doing, not declaring.</li>\n<li>Use title if you are really doing that.</li>\n<li>Don’t announce anything.</li>\n<li>Don’t choose a name.</li>\n<li>Don’t make a website or an app.</li>\n<li>Don’t build a system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What comes with business?\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t do everything you have prioritize somethings only.</li>\n<li>To make money you have to let go your freedom.</li>\n<li>Be honest to yourself what you want to pursue.</li>\n<li>But when you go against the stereotype, people get confused. Ex: <strong>The\nentrepreneur who’s not into money.</strong></li>\n<li>You first action wasn’t most honest but it’s answer that you came up\ninstead of thinking deep.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Socialize\n<ul>\n<li>Little steps can make lot of difference.</li>\n<li>Avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate you. They’re not allowed in my life\nright now, not even for a minute. No big explanation needed. No compromise.\nNo favors.</li>\n<li>Like blocking this things: Social media comments, Distracting environments,\nDiscouraging family members &amp; Your email inbox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of decisions\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three things to consider when making life-size decisions.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>What makes you happy</li>\n<li>What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you</li>\n<li>What’s useful to others</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Smart and useful (but not happy)\n<ul>\n<li>Smart and useful isn’t bad. It’s rational, like a machine. But happiness\nis the oil. Without it, the friction kills the engine.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the strict parent who says, “You will go to the\nbest school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make\nlots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you\nand your family.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and smart (but not useful)\n<ul>\n<li>They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something\nthat’s really valuable to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:\nalways learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be\nhappy and create the perfect life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and useful (but not smart)\n<ul>\n<li>But if a graduate’s time could be worth 200 per hour, yet they’re doing\nwork that locals could do better for10 per hour (and without airfare and\nhotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of charity volunteers. After getting expensive\nuniversity degrees, they spend years flying to exotic impoverished places\nto dig wells and thatch roofs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Points\n<ul>\n<li>How to learn?\n<ul>\n<li>Learning without doing is wasted.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do change your mindset?\n<ul>\n<li>Doubt what I know. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. Require current\nproof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed. What got me\nhere won’t get me there.</li>\n<li>Old ways don’t work anymore. You have to change see beyond your tunnel\nview. Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.\nIf you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and\nno responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever\nelse, you need to realize it and embrace it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could\nchange your mind soon.\n<ul>\n<li>I have to smile, thinking about what my former self would say. But the\nformer self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions\nas if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just\nthe result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t\ndefine who we are in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the\nnext-lower one.\n<ul>\n<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get\nit, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that\nsilver envy. Instead, if you aim to buy the “good enough” thing, it will\nkeep you in the bronze mindset. Since you’re not comparing to the best,\nyou’ll feel no need to keep up.</li>\n<li>Trying to be the best at a specific skill, it’s good to be dissatisfied.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ego\n<ul>\n<li>Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.</li>\n<li>I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at\nall.</li>\n<li>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Smart &amp; Stupid\n<ul>\n<li>Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to find the\nreal answer, <strong>not the easiest answer.</strong></li>\n<li>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. <strong>Jumping\nto a conclusion is like quitting a game.</strong> You lose by default.</li>\n<li>So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped\nthinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to overcome comfort zone?\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re scared to talk to someone intimidating. You notice you’re\nscared. Whatever scares you, go do it.</li>\n<li>Once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore! As\nyou go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and\nless in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Think you are below average.\n<ul>\n<li>Thing people get wrong.\n<ul>\n<li>Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than\nthe average cancer patient.</li>\n<li>Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average\nteachers.</li>\n<li>Ninety percent of students think they are more intelligent than the\naverage student.</li>\n<li>Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Assume I’m below average.</li>\n<li>It serves well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped\nthinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Thing it is your fault.\n<ul>\n<li>When you forgive, you’re still assuming that they’re wrong and you’re the\nvictim.</li>\n<li>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged.</li>\n<li>People were just playing their part in the situation you helped create.</li>\n<li>Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can\nlearn from it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Productivity\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Step to improve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That one little action changes how you think about yourself.</li>\n<li>Having taken that one step, you start to think of yourself as brave, or an\nachiever, or a bit of an expert on a subject.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel generous, so you start to act\ngenerous, so you become generous.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel like a leader, so you start to\nact like a leader, so you become a leader.</li>\n<li>The world treats you as you treat yourself. Your actions show the world\nwho you are.</li>\n<li>You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So\nstart by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already. You\nwouldn’t wait. Nothing would stop you.</li>\n<li>The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. The future doesn’t\nexist.</li>\n<li>Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment</li>\n<li>You have to optimize for one main goal and have to let go others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If they really wanted to do it, they would have done it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.</li>\n<li>Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Present-focused people &amp; Future-focused people.</p>\n<p><strong>Present-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty</li>\n<li>Focus on immediate gratification</li>\n<li>Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them</li>\n<li>Are playful, impulsive, and sensual</li>\n<li>Avoid anything boring, difficult, or repetitive</li>\n<li>Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time</li>\n<li>Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol</li>\n<li>Are better at helping others than helping themselves</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Future-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delay gratification</li>\n<li>Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future\ngoals</li>\n<li>Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and\npossible futures</li>\n<li>Especially love their work</li>\n<li>Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams</li>\n<li>Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others</li>\n<li>Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the\nexpense of personal relationships, which require a present focus</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No &amp; Yes</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s an easier decision. Say no to almost everything. This starts to free\nyour time and mind.</li>\n<li>Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have\nthe space in your life to give it your full attention.</li>\n<li>Saying no makes your yes more powerful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s good to say yes when you’re starting out.</li>\n<li>Wanting any opportunity, or needing variety.</li>\n<li>It’s bad to say yes when you’re overwhelmed, over-committed, or need to\nfocus.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most of effort wasn’t effort at all but just an unnecessary stress.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Stupid</strong> - Avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a\nconclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart</strong> - It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Long term</strong> - Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years,\nthen another.</p>\n<p><strong>Short term</strong> - assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t\nhappen.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>One day, I wrote a blog post sharing what I had learned while switching between\nthe PHP programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. At the time, my blog\nhad no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the\nrecord.</p>\n<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,\nand it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand\ncomments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>\n<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,\nsomething switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They\nweren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked\nlike me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they\nhad never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,\nbecause they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and\nspewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was\nfunny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the\nspotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some\nfamous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The\nrichest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve\noptimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take\nless money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that\ndeal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,\nentirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t\nsocialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business\ngrow quickly.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —\nsuper productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in\nPortland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused\nglobally.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to\nget fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every\nrequest, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent\nmost of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and\nunfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two\nhours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole\nworld, including that one person.</p>\n<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new\narticles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>\n<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my\ncommunity, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old\ncompany had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.\nCustomers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they\nwished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It\ntook me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients\na favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most\nsuccessful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8\nmillion for thousands of musicians.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Time Paradox — Philip Zimbardo</li>\n<li>Turning Pro — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>The Resistance — Gemma Malley</li>\n<li>The War of Art — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Do the Work — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Ego is the Enemy — Ryan Holiday</li>\n<li>Forever Nomad — Tynan, Rolf Potts, Derek Sivers, Leo Babauta, and Todd Iceton</li>\n<li>Positioning — Al Ries and Jack Trout</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://brightthemag.com/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d\">The Reductive Seduction Of Other People’s Problems</a></p>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Art is useless by definition.

Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>\n<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it.

Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m a student, not a guru.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it’s not a hit, switch</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No business plan survives first contact with customers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steve Blank:</p>",

Trust your instincts and don’t think too long. Relax. Toss a coin. Forgive, but don’t forget. To thine own self be true.</p>\n<p>The math shows that when there are a lot of applicants left in the pool, you should pass up even a very good applicant in the hopes of finding someone still better than that—but as your options dwindle, you should be prepared to hire anyone who’s simply better than average.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to understand the numbers for this scenario is to start at the end and think backward. If you’re down to the last applicant, of course, you are necessarily forced to choose her. But when looking at the next-to-last applicant, the question becomes: is she above the 50th percentile? If yes, then hire her; if not, it’s worth rolling the dice on the last applicant instead, since her odds of being above the 50th percentile are 50/50 by definition. Likewise, you should choose the third-to-last applicant if she’s above the 69th percentile, the fourth-to-last applicant if she’s above the 78th, and so on, being more choosy the more applicants are left.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Living by the wisdom of computer science doesn’t sound so bad after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for planning on ‘unexpected traffic,’ I think you should plan on expected traffic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>UCLA Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning Donald Shoup</li>\n</ul>",

Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark\nugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all\nthe awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part\nof you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,\nrather than against it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>\n<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get\nstronger and healthier and happier.</li>\n<li>Goal vs Habits\n<ul>\n<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X\namount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>\n<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one’s efforts\nfor a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest\nthem in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>\n<li>People don’t develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is\ndifferent.</li>\n<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,\nmake other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.\n<ul>\n<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some\nform of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone\nto quit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You wouldn’t keep watching a TV show you don’t like.

He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know\nhow he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too\noverwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey\nman, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed\nby a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off\nwith a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for\ngood measure.</li>\n<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting\nsomebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

If people give you money, it’s proof that\nyou’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate\nto you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>\n<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

Dr. Seuss came\nback and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s\nbooks of all time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter\nuntil my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed.\nBut instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try\nto channel it into my writing and my drawing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but\nthen I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade\nhardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.</p>\n<p>About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel\nwhole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my\nwriting, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell\nthat new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has\nadmitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of\nhis heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized\nhe couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type\nas the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his\nown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Linda Barry, What It Is</li>\n<li>Hugh MacLeod, Ignore Everybody</li>\n<li>Jason Fried + David Heinemeier Hansson, Rework</li>\n<li>Lewis Hyde, The Gift</li>\n<li>Jonathan Lethem, The Ecstasy of Influence</li>\n<li>David Shields, Reality Hunger</li>\n<li>Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics</li>\n<li>Anne Lamott, Bird by Bird</li>\n<li>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow</li>\n<li>Ed Emberley, Make a World</li>\n<li>Dr. Seuss, The Cat in the Hat</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When people call something “original,” nine out of ten times they just don’t\nknow the references or the original sources involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Jonathan Lethem</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Everything that needs to be said has already been said.

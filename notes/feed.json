It is doesn’t matter that much.</li>\n<li>It’s all about the product. The user cares about what you’ve built and how it\nsolves their problem, not so much about how you got there.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of\ndevelopment.</li>\n<li>If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally\nbelong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you’re aware of\nthat possibility.</li>\n<li>Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.</li>\n<li>Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks\nhave conventions for how things are organized.</li>\n<li>Consistent code style. It doesn’t matter what styles you choose.</li>\n<li>start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an “About Me” web page, a\nmetric unit converter.</li>\n<li>Burned out</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>I didn’t want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.</li>\n<li>You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or\nlong-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay</li>\n<li>Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.</li>\n<li>Keep your personal life separate from your work life.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Be the change you wish to see in our industry.</li>\n<li>What I call myself</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower\nthan Junior Software Developer.</li>\n<li>The programmer is a term that’s gone the way of the dinosaur.</li>\n<li>The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If\nyour job involves building condominiums, you’re reading the wrong book.</li>\n<li>Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the\nhighest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally\nI’ve heard it defined in contradictory ways.</li>\n<li>JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good\nname.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>DevOps</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and\noperations people.</li>\n<li>The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny\noperating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely\nportable.</li>\n<li>If you don’t understand something, Google it. If you can’t figure it out\neasily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.</li>\n<li>If someone has told you otherwise, you’re in the wrong company. Automate as\nmuch as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far\nmore time-consuming.</li>\n<li>Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need\nto keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce\nthese expenses dramatically.</li>\n<li>Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements\nchange or a solution already exists.</li>\n<li>Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.</li>\n<li>Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the “best way” to do\nsomething.</li>\n<li>The three virtues.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall\nenergy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people\nwill find useful and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so\nmany questions about it.</li>\n<li>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you\nwrite programs that don’t just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate\nthem. Or at least pretend to.</li>\n<li>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other\npeople won’t want to say bad things about.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>When you’re first reading about something new in code.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is this important or useful?</li>\n<li>How does it fit with other topics or technologies?</li>\n<li>What’s the problem that it’s trying to solve?</li>\n</ul>",

Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark\nugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all\nthe awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part\nof you and it’s never going away. And that’s fine. You can work with this,\nrather than against it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>\n<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get\nstronger and healthier and happier.</li>\n<li>Goal vs Habits\n<ul>\n<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. “I will spend X\namount of energy to receive Y reward.”</li>\n<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one’s efforts\nfor a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest\nthem in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>\n<li>People don’t develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is\ndifferent.</li>\n<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,\nmake other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.\n<ul>\n<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some\nform of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone\nto quit</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You wouldn’t keep watching a TV show you don’t like. You wouldn’t eat an\nentire plate of food you don’t like. So why the hell are you trying to read a\nbook you don’t like?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stores</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Waight Loss\n<ul>\n<li>I know someone who lost a lot of weight (almost 80 lbs) over a 2-year\nperiod. He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know\nhow he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too\noverwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey\nman, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed\nby a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off\nwith a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for\ngood measure.</li>\n<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting\nsomebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>\n<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>\n<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>\n<li>About ourselves\n<ul>\n<li>Order &amp; Chaos\n<ul>\n<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>\n<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>\n<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rules\n<ul>\n<li>We are rule generators. Humans can’t live without rules.</li>\n<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hierarchy of value\n<ul>\n<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>\n<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emotions\n<ul>\n<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>\n<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Women\n<ul>\n<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>\n<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>\n<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ideologies\n<ul>\n<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>\n<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>\n<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Meaning\n<ul>\n<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>\n<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why we are not equal?\n<ul>\n<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>\n<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>\n<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>\n<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why you compare yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>\n<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>\n<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>\n<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>\n<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who are you?\n<ul>\n<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>\n<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>\n<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>\n<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>\n<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>\n<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>\n<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>\n<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>\n<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What not to do?\n<ul>\n<li>Low self-worth people\n<ul>\n<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>\n<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>\n<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>\n<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How internal critic puts you down?\n<ul>\n<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>\n<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>\n<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>\n<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consequence of remaining silent.\n<ul>\n<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>\n<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>\n<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What people do that they don’t think they do?\n<ul>\n<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>\n<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>\n<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manipulate the World\n<ul>\n<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>\n<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>\n<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>\n<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to stop doing?\n<ul>\n<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>\n<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>\n<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>\n<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>\n<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>\n<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Children\n<ul>\n<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>\n<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About lies\n<ul>\n<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>\n<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>\n<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>\n<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>\n<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to\n<ul>\n<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>\n<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>\n<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women\n<ul>\n<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>\n<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>\n<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>\n<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>\n<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>\n<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>\n<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>\n<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>\n<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>\n<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>About Truth\n<ul>\n<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>\n<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>\n<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>\n<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>\n<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>\n<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>\n<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>\n<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>\n<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>\n<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Self\n<ul>\n<li>Why to take care of yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>\n<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>\n<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>\n<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>\n<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Steps to improve yourself.\n<ul>\n<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>\n<li>Speak your mind.</li>\n<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>\n<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>\n<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>\n<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement Steps\n<ul>\n<li>Start with yourself.</li>\n<li>Take care with yourself.</li>\n<li>Define who you are.</li>\n<li>Refine your personality.</li>\n<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>\n<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to know yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>\n<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>\n<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?\n<ul>\n<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>\n<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>\n<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>\n<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why life is a game?\n<ul>\n<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>\n<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>\n<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>\n<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>\n<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to win?\n<ul>\n<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>\n<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>\n<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture\n<ul>\n<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>\n<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To improve your life aim small.\n<ul>\n<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>\n<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>\n<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>\n<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?\n<ul>\n<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>\n<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>\n<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>\n<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>\n<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>\n<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the truth.</li>\n<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Listening to other people\n<ul>\n<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>\n<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>\n<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>\n<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>\n<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>\n<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>\n<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>\n<li>Don’t blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>\n<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>\n<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>\n<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>\n<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>\n<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>\n<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Relationship\n<ul>\n<li>Why we save people?\n<ul>\n<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>\n<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>\n<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>\n<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why not help some people?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>\n<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>\n<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?\n<ul>\n<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>\n<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>\n<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bad Friends\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>\n<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>\n<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>\n<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>\n<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>\n<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>\n<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>\n<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>\n<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>\n<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>\n<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>\n<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>\n<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>\n<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you.

Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>\n<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Nicomachean Ethics — Aristotle</li>\n<li>Orphan X — Gregg Hurwitz</li>\n<li>Notes from Underground — Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>\n<li>Crime and Punishment — Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>\n<li>Beyond Good and Evil — Friedrich Nietzsche</li>\n<li>Lord of the Flies — William Golding</li>\n<li>The Gulag Archipelago — Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Word that produces order from Chaos sacrifices everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Jordan Peterson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first of these rules is that the game is important.

If you’re down to the last applicant, of course, you are necessarily forced to choose her. But when looking at the next-to-last applicant, the question becomes: is she above the 50th percentile? If yes, then hire her; if not, it’s worth rolling the dice on the last applicant instead, since her odds of being above the 50th percentile are 50/50 by definition. Likewise, you should choose the third-to-last applicant if she’s above the 69th percentile, the fourth-to-last applicant if she’s above the 78th, and so on, being more choosy the more applicants are left.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Living by the wisdom of computer science doesn’t sound so bad after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for planning on ‘unexpected traffic,’ I think you should plan on expected traffic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>UCLA Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning Donald Shoup</li>\n</ul>",

That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

But if you value it because you are in the military and\nwant to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.Controllable</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.\nCreativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because\nyou CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a\nside effect.</li>\n<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,\nstanding up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>\n<h3>Bad values are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Emotion-based</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions\nand are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge\nor information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are\ngenerally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term\ngains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Destructive</li>\n<li>Uncontrollable</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up\nyour life to that thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,\nfeeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being\nalone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,\nsacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>\n<h3>How to change values?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into\nvaluing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite\neffect—they double down).</li>\n<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes\nthis contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.\nToo much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>\n<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The world sucks</li>\n<li>We suck</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of\ntrying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a\nfew. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving\nyour best effort.</li>\n<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always\nneed more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will\nneed more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need\nless money.</li>\n<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control\nwhether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You\ncan always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always\ncontrol if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something\nyou find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>\n<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings\nor even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>\n<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every\naspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with\nyour father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for\nrespect.\n<ul>\n<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>\n<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.\n<ul>\n<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an\nadult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>\n<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,\nbecause to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you\nare obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fault</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to\nmake them perfect too.</li>\n<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>\n<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter\nwhose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big\nhole, start climbing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>\n<h3>FAIL</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad\nlong-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.\n<ul>\n<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not\ndoing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where\npursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is\nintrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>\n<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who\ndon’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life\nplans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up\na mountain for a molehill.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right\nreasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>\n<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to\nnever love at all.</li>\n</ul>",

Colleges\nhave always been more liberal than the American population.</li>\n<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces\n(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and\nmanpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic\nhappens, and it fails to make the news.</li>\n<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared\nwith only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but\nwithout data, you would never know it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement of world\n<ul>\n<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more\nfortunate countries to 81.</li>\n<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>\n<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most\nliberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking\ncountries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist\ncountries of central Europe.</li>\n<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the\nidea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over\ntime.</li>\n<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th\ncentury, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car\naccident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99\npercent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall\nto their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less\nlikely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent\nless likely to be killed on the job.</li>\n<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human\nlife. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward\nmore mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life\nvirtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and\nthey constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that\nthis tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the\nstagnation of progress.</li>\n<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have\nvalues today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement in Lifestyle\n<ul>\n<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in\n2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the\nwashing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the\nIndustrial Revolution.</li>\n<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children\nthan stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>\n<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty\nrate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10\npercent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>\n<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier\nthan their helicoptering parents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human nature\n<ul>\n<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those\nwith meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>\n<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones\nmakes it more meaningful.</li>\n<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,\nstruggle, and worry.</li>\n<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are\nopened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely\nhuman cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past\nand stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of\nacquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability\nto persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and\nefficacy.</li>\n<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to\nthink it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and\nhelplessness.</li>\n<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor\nplummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out\nof desperation rather than greed.</li>\n<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>\n<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an\neffective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biases\n<ul>\n<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,\nto discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>\n<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with\nthe consequences of their opinions.</li>\n<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when\nthey are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are\nafter the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>\n<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as\nmuch as is feasible.</li>\n<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like\nit if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the\nother—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective\nmerits.</li>\n<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their\nbeliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you\nthan to pay attention to those who agree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Social Media\n<ul>\n<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,\nfeel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>\n<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and\nthey empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their\nsuccesses.</li>\n<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely\nto want a large number of friend.</li>\n<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the\n1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,\nhave become any less social.</li>\n<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,\nunions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal\ngatherings and via digital media.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tech\n<ul>\n<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed\nto weaponize it.</li>\n<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work\nto defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>\n<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into\npreventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of\nyears of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of\nbiology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Countries\n<ul>\n<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and\nregulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western\nEurope) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to\nlive, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human\nflourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,\nand happiness.</li>\n<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries\nhave gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get\nhappier still.</li>\n<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in\nliberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market\nfreedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>\n<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but\nwhat about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in\nboring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without\nviolence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the\nformer Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cyber Attack\n<ul>\n<li>The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking\nconfidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016\nAmerican election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a\nbotnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.</li>\n<li>Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Weapon\n<ul>\n<li>The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the\nworld’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make\nlousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,\nand citizens of the side that uses them.</li>\n<li>The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works\nagainst the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.</li>\n<li>Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold\nvirus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can\nshake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy\nand kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body\nto body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for\ncholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish\nflu).</li>\n<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States\ncan launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber\naircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a\nfirst strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Forecasters\n<ul>\n<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or\nright-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but\nmisguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event\nwas to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned\nout to be.</li>\n<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they\ncould. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their\nspeech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on\nthe other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not\ncertainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more\nreadily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>\n<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to\nexperience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for\ncognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative\ncomplexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>\n<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are\nneither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their\nabilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as\n“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>\n<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and\nconfirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Religions\n<ul>\n<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are\neducation, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other\nsocial services.</li>\n<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no\nreligion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or\npoverty on the scales.</li>\n<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than\nstay-at-homes, but</li>\n<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is\nas charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer\nwho prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>\n<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced\natheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be\nfanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of\natheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far\nin the 21st.</li>\n<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as\n“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”\ndown from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>\n<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other\nfactors constant.</li>\n<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,\nthey stop believing in miracles.</li>\n<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>\n<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,\nthe more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who care about you?\n<ul>\n<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is\nmeaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>\n<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws\nof the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>\n<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan\nyour children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>\n<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense\nof feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across\nbillions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is\ncosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a\nresponsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in\nwhich we all can flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been\nlowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>\n<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>\n<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the\nthings that happen in the world is that people solve the problems\nconfronting them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><em>Wordsmithing</em> - The making of changes to a text to improve clarity and style.</p>\n<p><em>Catastrophize</em> - Worse then it truly is</p>\n<p><em>Modicum</em> - Small quantity of valuable thing</p>\n<p><em>Emphatic</em> - Forcefully and Clearly</p>\n<p><em>Millennials</em> - Those born after 1980</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the\nliberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed\nit—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong\nmore often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased\ncrime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal\nnumerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our\ncivilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to\nChristian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,\n“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this\nnation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the\nface of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars\nwas spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge\nthat was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your\nmother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet. Um .\n. . Could you install it for us?”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Spain was an economic laggard among Western countries, even though Spaniards\nwere highly schooled, because Spanish education was controlled by the Catholic\nChurch, and “the children of the masses received only oral instruction in the\nCreed, the catechism, and a few simple manual skills. . . . Science,\nmathematics, political economy, and secular history were considered too\ncontroversial for anyone but trained theologians.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Blank Slate - Steven Pinker</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn’t mean it\nwas better in the past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steven Pinker</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any movement that calls itself “scientific” but fails to nurture opportunities\nfor the testing of its own beliefs is not a scientific movement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steven Pinker</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Richard Feynman</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most readers have no idea whether their favorite columnists, gurus, or talking\nheads are more accurate than a chimpanzee picking bananas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steven Pinker</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If either the right wing or the left wing gained control of the country, it\nwould fly around in circles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Pat Paulsen</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don’t believe in reason; we use reason</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Steven Pinker</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am not an optimist.

But\nthis means you have less time to focus on the rest of the world.</li>\n<li>If you’re global, you make things for the whole world. But this means you\nhave less time to be part of your local community.</li>\n<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t\nsee it until we get outside of it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Job Vs Art\n<ul>\n<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing\nsatisfy your entire life.\n<ul>\n<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid\nstability for part of your day, but then need creative time for\nexpression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art\nto the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then\nlong for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid\nfuture. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when\nfactoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a\nfew years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a\nhead choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job\nyour entire life.</li>\n<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.\nKeep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to get inspiration?\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>\n<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to start?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>\n<li>If you love something copy it. Nothing is OG.</li>\n<li>You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.</li>\n<li>Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal\nservice. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What don’t do?\n<ul>\n<li>Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action. But\nsuccess comes from doing, not declaring.</li>\n<li>Use title if you are really doing that.</li>\n<li>Don’t announce anything.</li>\n<li>Don’t choose a name.</li>\n<li>Don’t make a website or an app.</li>\n<li>Don’t build a system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What comes with business?\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t do everything you have prioritize somethings only.</li>\n<li>To make money you have to let go your freedom.</li>\n<li>Be honest to yourself what you want to pursue.</li>\n<li>But when you go against the stereotype, people get confused. Ex: <strong>The\nentrepreneur who’s not into money.</strong></li>\n<li>You first action wasn’t most honest but it’s answer that you came up\ninstead of thinking deep.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Socialize\n<ul>\n<li>Little steps can make lot of difference.</li>\n<li>Avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate you. They’re not allowed in my life\nright now, not even for a minute. No big explanation needed. No compromise.\nNo favors.</li>\n<li>Like blocking this things: Social media comments, Distracting environments,\nDiscouraging family members &amp; Your email inbox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of decisions\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three things to consider when making life-size decisions.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>What makes you happy</li>\n<li>What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you</li>\n<li>What’s useful to others</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Smart and useful (but not happy)\n<ul>\n<li>Smart and useful isn’t bad. It’s rational, like a machine. But happiness\nis the oil. Without it, the friction kills the engine.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the strict parent who says, “You will go to the\nbest school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make\nlots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you\nand your family.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and smart (but not useful)\n<ul>\n<li>They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something\nthat’s really valuable to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:\nalways learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be\nhappy and create the perfect life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and useful (but not smart)\n<ul>\n<li>But if a graduate’s time could be worth 200 per hour, yet they’re doing\nwork that locals could do better for10 per hour (and without airfare and\nhotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of charity volunteers. After getting expensive\nuniversity degrees, they spend years flying to exotic impoverished places\nto dig wells and thatch roofs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Points\n<ul>\n<li>How to learn?\n<ul>\n<li>Learning without doing is wasted.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do change your mindset?\n<ul>\n<li>Doubt what I know. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. Require current\nproof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed. What got me\nhere won’t get me there.</li>\n<li>Old ways don’t work anymore. You have to change see beyond your tunnel\nview. Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.\nIf you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and\nno responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever\nelse, you need to realize it and embrace it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could\nchange your mind soon.\n<ul>\n<li>I have to smile, thinking about what my former self would say. But the\nformer self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions\nas if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just\nthe result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t\ndefine who we are in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the\nnext-lower one.\n<ul>\n<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get\nit, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that\nsilver envy. Instead, if you aim to buy the “good enough” thing, it will\nkeep you in the bronze mindset. Since you’re not comparing to the best,\nyou’ll feel no need to keep up.</li>\n<li>Trying to be the best at a specific skill, it’s good to be dissatisfied.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ego\n<ul>\n<li>Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.</li>\n<li>I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at\nall.</li>\n<li>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Smart &amp; Stupid\n<ul>\n<li>Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to find the\nreal answer, <strong>not the easiest answer.</strong></li>\n<li>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. <strong>Jumping\nto a conclusion is like quitting a game.</strong> You lose by default.</li>\n<li>So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped\nthinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to overcome comfort zone?\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re scared to talk to someone intimidating. You notice you’re\nscared. Whatever scares you, go do it.</li>\n<li>Once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore! As\nyou go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and\nless in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Think you are below average.\n<ul>\n<li>Thing people get wrong.\n<ul>\n<li>Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than\nthe average cancer patient.</li>\n<li>Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average\nteachers.</li>\n<li>Ninety percent of students think they are more intelligent than the\naverage student.</li>\n<li>Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Assume I’m below average.</li>\n<li>It serves well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped\nthinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Thing it is your fault.\n<ul>\n<li>When you forgive, you’re still assuming that they’re wrong and you’re the\nvictim.</li>\n<li>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged.</li>\n<li>People were just playing their part in the situation you helped create.</li>\n<li>Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can\nlearn from it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Productivity\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Step to improve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That one little action changes how you think about yourself.</li>\n<li>Having taken that one step, you start to think of yourself as brave, or an\nachiever, or a bit of an expert on a subject.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel generous, so you start to act\ngenerous, so you become generous.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel like a leader, so you start to\nact like a leader, so you become a leader.</li>\n<li>The world treats you as you treat yourself. Your actions show the world\nwho you are.</li>\n<li>You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So\nstart by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already. You\nwouldn’t wait. Nothing would stop you.</li>\n<li>The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. The future doesn’t\nexist.</li>\n<li>Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment</li>\n<li>You have to optimize for one main goal and have to let go others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If they really wanted to do it, they would have done it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.</li>\n<li>Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Present-focused people &amp; Future-focused people.</p>\n<p><strong>Present-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty</li>\n<li>Focus on immediate gratification</li>\n<li>Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them</li>\n<li>Are playful, impulsive, and sensual</li>\n<li>Avoid anything boring, difficult, or repetitive</li>\n<li>Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time</li>\n<li>Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol</li>\n<li>Are better at helping others than helping themselves</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Future-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delay gratification</li>\n<li>Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future\ngoals</li>\n<li>Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and\npossible futures</li>\n<li>Especially love their work</li>\n<li>Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams</li>\n<li>Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others</li>\n<li>Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the\nexpense of personal relationships, which require a present focus</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No &amp; Yes</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s an easier decision.

Jumping to a\nconclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart</strong> - It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Long term</strong> - Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years,\nthen another.</p>\n<p><strong>Short term</strong> - assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t\nhappen.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>One day, I wrote a blog post sharing what I had learned while switching between\nthe PHP programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. At the time, my blog\nhad no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the\nrecord.</p>\n<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,\nand it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand\ncomments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>\n<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,\nsomething switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They\nweren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked\nlike me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they\nhad never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,\nbecause they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and\nspewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was\nfunny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the\nspotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some\nfamous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The\nrichest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve\noptimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take\nless money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that\ndeal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,\nentirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t\nsocialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business\ngrow quickly.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —\nsuper productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in\nPortland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused\nglobally.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to\nget fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every\nrequest, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent\nmost of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and\nunfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two\nhours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole\nworld, including that one person.</p>\n<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new\narticles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>\n<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my\ncommunity, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old\ncompany had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.\nCustomers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they\nwished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It\ntook me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients\na favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most\nsuccessful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8\nmillion for thousands of musicians.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Time Paradox — Philip Zimbardo</li>\n<li>Turning Pro — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>The Resistance — Gemma Malley</li>\n<li>The War of Art — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Do the Work — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Ego is the Enemy — Ryan Holiday</li>\n<li>Forever Nomad — Tynan, Rolf Potts, Derek Sivers, Leo Babauta, and Todd Iceton</li>\n<li>Positioning — Al Ries and Jack Trout</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://brightthemag.com/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d\">The Reductive Seduction Of Other People’s Problems</a></p>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Art is useless by definition.

      "content_html": "<h2>Points</h2>\n<p>There is one difference, though. To be a Catholic, you have to have faith, because no one has ever seen the Holy Ghost. To be a progressive, you have to have trust, because you believe that your worldview accurately reflects the real world—as experienced not just by your own small eyes, but by humanity as a whole.</p>\n<p>None of them hates Washington as a whole. So they can never unite to destroy it, and the whole machine is stable. See how beautiful this is? By separating voters into two competing but cooperating parties, neither of which can destroy the other, the two-party system creates a government which will survive indefinitely, no matter how much happier its citizens might be without it.</p>\n<h2>Sentences</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And the world changed. Before the 1960s, colonial governments and companies fought malaria because their officials often lived in remote outposts like Nigeria’s hill stations and Vietnam’s Marble Mountains. Independence movements led to freedom, but also often to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care.</strong></p>\n<p>What we see here is that independence movements—which the writer clearly believes are a good thing—led to some very concrete and very, very awful results, in addition to this curious abstraction—freedom. Clearly, whatever freedom means in this particular context, it’s such a great positive that even when you add it to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care, the result still exceeds zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what does it mean for a government to be “free,” anyway? Is the government of North Korea “free?” What about ExxonMobil? Or the Democratic Party? I have a fairly good understanding of what it means for a human being to be “free.” When it comes to an organization, especially one which claims to be a “government,” I’m quite without a clue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>\n<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>\n<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>\n<li>About ourselves\n<ul>\n<li>Order &amp; Chaos\n<ul>\n<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>\n<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>\n<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rules\n<ul>\n<li>We are rule generators. Humans can’t live without rules.</li>\n<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hierarchy of value\n<ul>\n<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>\n<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Emotions\n<ul>\n<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>\n<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Women\n<ul>\n<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>\n<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>\n<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ideologies\n<ul>\n<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>\n<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>\n<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Meaning\n<ul>\n<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>\n<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why we are not equal?\n<ul>\n<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>\n<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>\n<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>\n<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why you compare yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>\n<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>\n<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>\n<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>\n<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Who are you?\n<ul>\n<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>\n<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>\n<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>\n<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>\n<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>\n<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>\n<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>\n<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>\n<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What not to do?\n<ul>\n<li>Low self-worth people\n<ul>\n<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>\n<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>\n<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>\n<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How internal critic puts you down?\n<ul>\n<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>\n<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>\n<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>\n<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consequence of remaining silent.\n<ul>\n<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>\n<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>\n<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What people do that they don’t think they do?\n<ul>\n<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>\n<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>\n<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Manipulate the World\n<ul>\n<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>\n<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>\n<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>\n<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to stop doing?\n<ul>\n<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>\n<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>\n<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>\n<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>\n<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>\n<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Children\n<ul>\n<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>\n<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About lies\n<ul>\n<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>\n<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>\n<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>\n<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>\n<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to\n<ul>\n<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>\n<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>\n<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women\n<ul>\n<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>\n<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>\n<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>\n<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>\n<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>\n<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>\n<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>\n<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>\n<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>\n<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>About Truth\n<ul>\n<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>\n<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>\n<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>\n<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>\n<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>\n<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>\n<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>\n<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>\n<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>\n<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Self\n<ul>\n<li>Why to take care of yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>\n<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>\n<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>\n<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>\n<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Steps to improve yourself.\n<ul>\n<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>\n<li>Speak your mind.</li>\n<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>\n<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>\n<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>\n<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement Steps\n<ul>\n<li>Start with yourself.</li>\n<li>Take care with yourself.</li>\n<li>Define who you are.</li>\n<li>Refine your personality.</li>\n<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>\n<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to know yourself?\n<ul>\n<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>\n<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>\n<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?\n<ul>\n<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>\n<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>\n<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>\n<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why life is a game?\n<ul>\n<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>\n<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>\n<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>\n<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>\n<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to win?\n<ul>\n<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>\n<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>\n<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>\n<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture\n<ul>\n<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>\n<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To improve your life aim small.\n<ul>\n<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>\n<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>\n<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>\n<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?\n<ul>\n<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>\n<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>\n<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>\n<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>\n<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>\n<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the truth.</li>\n<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Listening to other people\n<ul>\n<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>\n<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>\n<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>\n<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>\n<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>\n<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>\n<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>\n<li>Don’t blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>\n<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>\n<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>\n<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>\n<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>\n<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>\n<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Relationship\n<ul>\n<li>Why we save people?\n<ul>\n<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>\n<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>\n<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>\n<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why not help some people?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>\n<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>\n<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?\n<ul>\n<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>\n<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>\n<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bad Friends\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>\n<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>\n<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>\n<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>\n<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>\n<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>\n<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>\n<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>\n<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>\n<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>\n<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>\n<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>\n<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>\n<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you. You need to give love before you re</strong>ce<strong>ive it.</strong></li>\n<li>When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About Culture\n<ul>\n<li>You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion.</li>\n<li>You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.</li>\n<li>The crowd is by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world and with the people you disagree with.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> - Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>\n<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Nicomachean Ethics — Aristotle</li>\n<li>Orphan X — Gregg Hurwitz</li>\n<li>Notes from Underground — Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>\n<li>Crime and Punishment — Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>\n<li>Beyond Good and Evil — Friedrich Nietzsche</li>\n<li>Lord of the Flies — William Golding</li>\n<li>The Gulag Archipelago — Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Word that produces order from Chaos sacrifices everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Jordan Peterson</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first of these rules is that the game is important.

      "content_html": "<h1>Hell Yeah or No</h1>\n<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 7:14 PM Page No.: 132\nProgress: ✔️</p>\n<p>A collection of thoughts around re-defining yourself, changing focus, and saying\nyes to less</p>\n<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus more on my global friends.</li>\n<li>Start comparing to my old self not other people.</li>\n<li>Start saying everything is my responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Points</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Business points\n<ul>\n<li>Local Vs Global\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re local, you focus on your community, doing things in-person. But\nthis means you have less time to focus on the rest of the world.</li>\n<li>If you’re global, you make things for the whole world. But this means you\nhave less time to be part of your local community.</li>\n<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t\nsee it until we get outside of it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Job Vs Art\n<ul>\n<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing\nsatisfy your entire life.\n<ul>\n<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid\nstability for part of your day, but then need creative time for\nexpression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art\nto the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then\nlong for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid\nfuture. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when\nfactoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a\nfew years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a\nhead choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job\nyour entire life.</li>\n<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.\nKeep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to get inspiration?\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>\n<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>\n<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to start?\n<ul>\n<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>\n<li>If you love something copy it. Nothing is OG.</li>\n<li>You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.</li>\n<li>Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal\nservice. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What don’t do?\n<ul>\n<li>Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action. But\nsuccess comes from doing, not declaring.</li>\n<li>Use title if you are really doing that.</li>\n<li>Don’t announce anything.</li>\n<li>Don’t choose a name.</li>\n<li>Don’t make a website or an app.</li>\n<li>Don’t build a system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What comes with business?\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t do everything you have prioritize somethings only.</li>\n<li>To make money you have to let go your freedom.</li>\n<li>Be honest to yourself what you want to pursue.</li>\n<li>But when you go against the stereotype, people get confused. Ex: <strong>The\nentrepreneur who’s not into money.</strong></li>\n<li>You first action wasn’t most honest but it’s answer that you came up\ninstead of thinking deep.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Socialize\n<ul>\n<li>Little steps can make lot of difference.</li>\n<li>Avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate you. They’re not allowed in my life\nright now, not even for a minute. No big explanation needed. No compromise.\nNo favors.</li>\n<li>Like blocking this things: Social media comments, Distracting environments,\nDiscouraging family members &amp; Your email inbox.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Effect of decisions\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three things to consider when making life-size decisions.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>What makes you happy</li>\n<li>What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you</li>\n<li>What’s useful to others</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Smart and useful (but not happy)\n<ul>\n<li>Smart and useful isn’t bad. It’s rational, like a machine. But happiness\nis the oil. Without it, the friction kills the engine.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the strict parent who says, “You will go to the\nbest school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make\nlots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you\nand your family.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and smart (but not useful)\n<ul>\n<li>They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something\nthat’s really valuable to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:\nalways learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be\nhappy and create the perfect life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Happy and useful (but not smart)\n<ul>\n<li>But if a graduate’s time could be worth 200 per hour, yet they’re doing\nwork that locals could do better for10 per hour (and without airfare and\nhotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.</li>\n<li>This is the stereotype of charity volunteers. After getting expensive\nuniversity degrees, they spend years flying to exotic impoverished places\nto dig wells and thatch roofs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self Points\n<ul>\n<li>How to learn?\n<ul>\n<li>Learning without doing is wasted.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What to do change your mindset?\n<ul>\n<li>Doubt what I know. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. Require current\nproof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed. What got me\nhere won’t get me there.</li>\n<li>Old ways don’t work anymore. You have to change see beyond your tunnel\nview. Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.\nIf you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and\nno responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever\nelse, you need to realize it and embrace it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could\nchange your mind soon.\n<ul>\n<li>I have to smile, thinking about what my former self would say. But the\nformer self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions\nas if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just\nthe result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t\ndefine who we are in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the\nnext-lower one.\n<ul>\n<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get\nit, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that\nsilver envy. Instead, if you aim to buy the “good enough” thing, it will\nkeep you in the bronze mindset. Since you’re not comparing to the best,\nyou’ll feel no need to keep up.</li>\n<li>Trying to be the best at a specific skill, it’s good to be dissatisfied.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ego\n<ul>\n<li>Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.</li>\n<li>I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at\nall.</li>\n<li>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Smart &amp; Stupid\n<ul>\n<li>Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to find the\nreal answer, <strong>not the easiest answer.</strong></li>\n<li>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. <strong>Jumping\nto a conclusion is like quitting a game.</strong> You lose by default.</li>\n<li>So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped\nthinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to overcome comfort zone?\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re scared to talk to someone intimidating. You notice you’re\nscared. Whatever scares you, go do it.</li>\n<li>Once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore! As\nyou go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and\nless in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Think you are below average.\n<ul>\n<li>Thing people get wrong.\n<ul>\n<li>Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than\nthe average cancer patient.</li>\n<li>Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average\nteachers.</li>\n<li>Ninety percent of students think they are more intelligent than the\naverage student.</li>\n<li>Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Assume I’m below average.</li>\n<li>It serves well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped\nthinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Thing it is your fault.\n<ul>\n<li>When you forgive, you’re still assuming that they’re wrong and you’re the\nvictim.</li>\n<li>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged.</li>\n<li>People were just playing their part in the situation you helped create.</li>\n<li>Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can\nlearn from it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Productivity\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Step to improve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That one little action changes how you think about yourself.</li>\n<li>Having taken that one step, you start to think of yourself as brave, or an\nachiever, or a bit of an expert on a subject.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel generous, so you start to act\ngenerous, so you become generous.</li>\n<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel like a leader, so you start to\nact like a leader, so you become a leader.</li>\n<li>The world treats you as you treat yourself. Your actions show the world\nwho you are.</li>\n<li>You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So\nstart by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already. You\nwouldn’t wait. Nothing would stop you.</li>\n<li>The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. The future doesn’t\nexist.</li>\n<li>Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment</li>\n<li>You have to optimize for one main goal and have to let go others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If they really wanted to do it, they would have done it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.</li>\n<li>Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Present-focused people &amp; Future-focused people.</p>\n<p><strong>Present-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty</li>\n<li>Focus on immediate gratification</li>\n<li>Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them</li>\n<li>Are playful, impulsive, and sensual</li>\n<li>Avoid anything boring, difficult, or repetitive</li>\n<li>Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time</li>\n<li>Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol</li>\n<li>Are better at helping others than helping themselves</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Future-focused people</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delay gratification</li>\n<li>Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future\ngoals</li>\n<li>Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and\npossible futures</li>\n<li>Especially love their work</li>\n<li>Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams</li>\n<li>Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others</li>\n<li>Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the\nexpense of personal relationships, which require a present focus</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No &amp; Yes</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s an easier decision. Say no to almost everything. This starts to free\nyour time and mind.</li>\n<li>Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have\nthe space in your life to give it your full attention.</li>\n<li>Saying no makes your yes more powerful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s good to say yes when you’re starting out.</li>\n<li>Wanting any opportunity, or needing variety.</li>\n<li>It’s bad to say yes when you’re overwhelmed, over-committed, or need to\nfocus.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most of effort wasn’t effort at all but just an unnecessary stress.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Stupid</strong> - Avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a\nconclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart</strong> - It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Long term</strong> - Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years,\nthen another.</p>\n<p><strong>Short term</strong> - assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t\nhappen.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>One day, I wrote a blog post sharing what I had learned while switching between\nthe PHP programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. At the time, my blog\nhad no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the\nrecord.</p>\n<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,\nand it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand\ncomments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>\n<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,\nsomething switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They\nweren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked\nlike me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they\nhad never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,\nbecause they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and\nspewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was\nfunny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the\nspotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some\nfamous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The\nrichest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve\noptimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take\nless money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that\ndeal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,\nentirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t\nsocialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business\ngrow quickly.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —\nsuper productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in\nPortland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused\nglobally.</p>\n<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to\nget fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every\nrequest, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent\nmost of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and\nunfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two\nhours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole\nworld, including that one person.</p>\n<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new\narticles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>\n<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my\ncommunity, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old\ncompany had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.\nCustomers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they\nwished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It\ntook me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients\na favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most\nsuccessful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8\nmillion for thousands of musicians.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The Time Paradox — Philip Zimbardo</li>\n<li>Turning Pro — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>The Resistance — Gemma Malley</li>\n<li>The War of Art — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Do the Work — Steven Pressfield</li>\n<li>Ego is the Enemy — Ryan Holiday</li>\n<li>Forever Nomad — Tynan, Rolf Potts, Derek Sivers, Leo Babauta, and Todd Iceton</li>\n<li>Positioning — Al Ries and Jack Trout</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://brightthemag.com/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d\">The Reductive Seduction Of Other People’s Problems</a></p>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— Derek Sivers</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Art is useless by definition.

Slow to enter because they’re\nworking on revolutionary products, services, or technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of\nevery four fail because of premature scaling—<strong>making investments that the\nmarket isn’t yet ready to support</strong>.</li>\n<li>The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to\nrush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.</li>\n<li>Conceptual &amp; Experimental innovators</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.\n<ul>\n<li>Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.</li>\n<li>Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.</li>\n<li>Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk\ncopying, themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and\nevolving as they go along.\n<ul>\n<li>Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.</li>\n<li>45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.</li>\n<li>The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: <strong>instead\nof reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering\nnew one’s</strong>.</li>\n<li>:eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate\nexpertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas\nfrom the past.</strong> Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your\nimagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your\nperipheral vision.</li>\n<li>The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more\nstrongly you identify with an extreme group, <strong>the harder you seek to\ndifferentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values</strong>.</li>\n<li>Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. <strong>When the overlap in\ntactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less\nlikely</strong>. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have\nless to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be\nredundant.</li>\n<li>You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing\nsomething original that challenges the status quo.</li>\n<li>Negative &amp; Ambivalent Relationship</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague\nconsistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.</li>\n<li>Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions\nabout when that person can actually be trusted.\n<ul>\n<li>Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative\nrelationships.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re\nthe ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet\nagain, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.</li>\n<li>People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started\nout negative and then become more positive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince\nthem to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing\ntheirs.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our\nagendas to familiar values that people already hold.</strong></li>\n<li>As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals\noccasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to\nattempt to steal a base.</li>\n<li>Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns\nbelieved in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.</li>\n<li>An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old\nfirstborn.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often\ncoincides with societal expectations.</li>\n<li>Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a\ncheater.”</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person\nin the mirror.</li>\n<li>But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality\nis tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of\nMeena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of <strong>Martin Luther King,\nJr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela</strong>.</li>\n<li>Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star,\nand commitment.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills:\nFounders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or\nscientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.\n<ul>\n<li>Failure rates we’re were worse.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future\npotential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The\nindividuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular\narea, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.\n<ul>\n<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and\nchallenging tasks.</li>\n<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural\nfit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the\ncompany’s values and norms.\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees\nand to the organization.</li>\n<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in\nthe organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the\nmission.</li>\n<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms\nwas zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>\n<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>\n<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model\nand more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>\n<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower\nthan star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>\n<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or\nintegrating a diverse workforce.</li>\n<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too\ninsular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and\nthey’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.\nAs a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more\nreliable financial results than their competitors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their\nperspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of\ndissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from\npeople who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>\n<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times\nhigher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the\nfounder’s original model.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of\nthe firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on\npotential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>\n<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the\nfounder.</li>\n<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with\ncommitment blueprints.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who\nreinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers\nthrow culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates\ncan improve the culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles\nagainst it than in support of it.</li>\n<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>\n<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the\nprinciples. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>\n<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on\ndifferent values or interpret the same values differently.</li>\n<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and\n<strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act\nin the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear\nof failing.</li>\n<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be\ncrippled by fear.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and\nconvert it into motivation.</li>\n<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering\nevery relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables\nthem to feel a sense of control.</li>\n<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the\ndifficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>\n<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature\npositive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic\nproduct decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too\noptimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention\nto potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to\ntake preventative and corrective actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more\nterrifying than the negative.</li>\n<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>\n<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re\nnot alone.</li>\n<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>\n<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to\nemphasize losses rather than gains.</li>\n<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with\nthe present.</li>\n<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation\nor revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better\nsystem. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>\n<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the\nfirst place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by\npeople, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to\nconsider how they can be improved.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>\n<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is\nincomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or\nwriting process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give\nideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>\n<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,\nand you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s\nalso tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they\nevaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by\npeers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>\n<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from\nLisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to\nspend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of\nbusiness</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.\nThen, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert\nthem into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>\n<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a\nmonthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones\nare worth solving.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do\nyou think this made her feel?”.</li>\n<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Story</h1>\n<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href=\"http://dosomething.org/\">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO\nNancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,\nbecause they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.\nEmployees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have\nto explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because\nthe title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to\ncontribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just\nthirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of\nspeaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for\ndelivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades\ntesting out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the\nthousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different\nmelodies and refrains.</p>\n<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a\nseries of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to\nexplain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.\nExplaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to\nexplain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.\nConsidering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize\nthat some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to\nencourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David\nHofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a\nsignificant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical\nprofessionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent\nmore soap and gel</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their\nearly thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,\nthe vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,\npsychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments\nto changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a\nmajor influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations\nto drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been\ninfluenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their\nmentors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse\nworkforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the\nnavy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he\ndidn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took\non; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and\ndedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same\npassions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and\ncohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your\norganization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever\nencountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.\nHeadquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in\ninvestments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its\nphilosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the\nfounder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a\nword about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any\nsituation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful\nwork and build meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees\nare hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating\nthat’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp\nmodeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the\nprinciples, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and\nevaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s\nalways a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,\nto the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for\nemployees to stay for decades.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,\nbut its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,\nboth of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.\nThey’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in\nthe history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the\ncombined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>\n<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the\nSteve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone\nspecial. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a\nmeeting with an important potential client:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50\nminutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all\nbecause there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the\noutset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a\n“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who\nattended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A\nto F.</p>\n<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be\nfired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the\ncountry’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,\nthey are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance\nby turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon\nthey saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to\nstart driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,\npedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars\nand trucks at a glacial pace.</p>\n<h1>Questions</h1>\n<h1>Quotes</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passionate people don’t wear their passion on their sleeves; they have it in\ntheir hearts. – Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They don’t wait for permission to start building something.

That’s all he\ncould do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout\nas he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>\n<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a\nfew more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could\nrun competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>\n<li>He didn’t say, “OK, I’m ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.”\nHe instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise\nbike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn’t feel too\noverwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Making Friends\n<ul>\n<li>Now, I don’t mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, “Hey\nman, what’s been going on with you lately? How have things been?” followed\nby a couple, “Oh, that’s cool, tell me about that,” and finally finished off\nwith a, “We should get together soon, what are you doing next week?” for\ngood measure.</li>\n<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it\nwas to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base\nwith some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>\n<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know\nsomeone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting\nsomebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Contact every three weeks.</li>\n<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>\n<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>\n<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have\ntheir correct info.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Normal World &amp; Business World\n<ul>\n<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they\ndon’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a\ntotal loser.</li>\n<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,\nyou’re a loser!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to be cool?\n<ul>\n<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal\nboring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had\nthe courage.</li>\n<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but\nit’s considerate and part of your art.</li>\n<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only\ngreat at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>\n<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them\ncurious.</li>\n<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme\ncharacter. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>About People\n<ul>\n<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>\n<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a\nfriend. That’s how things are done</li>\n<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that\nthing is popular.</li>\n<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with\nyour existing contacts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Business\n<ul>\n<li>How beat competitor?\n<ul>\n<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>\n<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>\n<li>Play a completely different game.</li>\n<li>Be radically opposite</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters\n<ul>\n<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.\nMake sure they stick together as a group.</li>\n<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not\nyourself. Make it fun to join.</li>\n<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are\nhaving.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been\ndone.\n<ul>\n<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use\nAmazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not\nbe able to imagine that niche without you.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your\nattention</li>\n<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that\nit’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>\n<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>\n<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,\ncompetition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,\nbeing a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>\n<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that\nyou’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate\nto you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>\n<h1>Stories</h1>\n<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>\n<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was\ncompletely ignored.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d\nreceived it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a\nsecond inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>\n<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the\nchance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it\nin a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare\ntime.</p>\n<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the\nthird inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a\nconference.</p>\n<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing\nproblem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to\nget the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the\npublisher.</p>\n<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for\npermission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they\ncontact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>\n<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>\n<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They\nlove it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,\n“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on\nmusic business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and\ntech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”\nSoon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing\ntheir instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,\nand lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious\nand overwhelming.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictably Irrational — Dan Ariely</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Quote</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever excites you, go do it.

For the extreme\ntakers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of\nevery ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four\nwere about themselves alone and no one else.</li>\n<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in\ntheir companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt\nentitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>\n<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms\n<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total\nshareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger\nlosses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung\nfor the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and\nlarger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.\nSometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put\ntheir companies in jeopardy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97\">Giver and Taker</a> On the left\nside is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about\nme.

Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form\nof punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker\ntendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as\n<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning\nbridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Storys</h1>\n<hr>\n<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored\nwith an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his\ncomputer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech\nserver. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the\nmusic.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band\nskyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>\n<h1>Meaning</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lekking</strong> - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their\nestablished positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court\nfemale audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs.

If you don’t make enemies\nout there, it’s easier to succeed. — Randy Komisar</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I have one vice, and I can call it nothing else—it is not to be able to say\nno! — Abraham Lincoln</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a\nmarathon. — Chip Conley</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A service provider. Entrepreneurs are not here to serve venture capitalists.\nWe are here to serve entrepreneurs. — David Hornik</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My default is to give, I’m not looking for quid pro quo; I’m looking to make a\ndifference and have an impact, and I focus on the people who can benefit from\nmy help the most. — Sherry and Please</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Above all, I want to demonstrate that success doesn’t have to come at someone\nelse’s expense. — David Hornik</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism\nor in the darkness of destructive selfishness. — Martin Luther King Jr.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely\nno good. — Samuel Johnson</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t\nsucceed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from\ninvestments in meaningful activities and relationships. — Wayne Baker</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social networks have always existed, It is only recently that the Internet has\nprovided a venue for their electronic explosion. . . . From mundane\ncommunication to meeting the love of one’s life to inciting political\nrevolutions, network ties are the conduits by which information and resources\nare spread. — Science</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s better to give before you receive. — Keith Ferrazzi</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you meet people you should be asking yourself, ‘How can I help the other\nperson? — Guy Kawasaki</p>\n</blockquote>",

<p>Author: Isaac Lyman Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 184 Progress:
✔️</p>
<ol>
<li>Code is more about People then line.</li>
<li>Bad Tools can waste your time sometimes.</li>
<li>Don’t be religious about your tools it is just a tool not a human even a
living thing.</li>
<li>Nobody cars about your code</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can use whatever coding language or framework you want it is just a line
of code that can change by anybody. It is doesn’t matter that much.</li>
<li>It’s all about the product. The user cares about what you’ve built and how it
solves their problem, not so much about how you got there.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of
development.</li>
<li>If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally
belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you’re aware of
that possibility.</li>
<li>Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.</li>
<li>Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks
have conventions for how things are organized.</li>
<li>Consistent code style. It doesn’t matter what styles you choose.</li>
<li>start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an “About Me” web page, a
metric unit converter.</li>
<li>Burned out</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.</li>
<li>You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or
long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay</li>
<li>Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.</li>
<li>Keep your personal life separate from your work life.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Be the change you wish to see in our industry.</li>
<li>What I call myself</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower
than Junior Software Developer.</li>
<li>The programmer is a term that’s gone the way of the dinosaur.</li>
<li>The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If
your job involves building condominiums, you’re reading the wrong book.</li>
<li>Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the
highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally
I’ve heard it defined in contradictory ways.</li>
<li>JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good
name.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and
operations people.</li>
<li>The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny
operating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely
portable.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand something, Google it. If you can’t figure it out
easily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.</li>
<li>If someone has told you otherwise, you’re in the wrong company. Automate as
much as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far
more time-consuming.</li>
<li>Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need
to keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce
these expenses dramatically.</li>
<li>Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements
change or a solution already exists.</li>
<li>Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.</li>
<li>Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the “best way” to do
something.</li>
<li>The three virtues.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall
energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people
will find useful and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so
many questions about it.</li>
<li>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you
write programs that don’t just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate
them. Or at least pretend to.</li>
<li>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other
people won’t want to say bad things about.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<ol>
<li>When you’re first reading about something new in code.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why is this important or useful?</li>
<li>How does it fit with other topics or technologies?</li>
<li>What’s the problem that it’s trying to solve?</li>
</ul>]]></content>

Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Education
<ul>
<li>More than 80 percent of the world was unschooled; by 1900.</li>
<li>83 percent of the world is literate.</li>
<li>Middle Eastern and North African countries, more than three-quarters of the
people over sixty-five are illiterate, whereas the rate for those in their
teens and twenties is in the single digits.</li>
<li>According to current projections, by the middle of this century, only five
countries will have more than a fifth of their population uneducated, and by
the end of the century the worldwide proportion will fall to zero.</li>
<li>Less-educated people reported having more leisure.</li>
<li>Early in the 19th century, 12 percent of the world could read and write;
today 83 percent can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Politics
<ul>
<li>Engagement with politics is like sports fandom in another way: people seek
and consume news to enhance the fan experience, not to make their opinions
more accurate.</li>
<li>Liberals are more hostile and aggressive.</li>
<li>Conservatives are indeed more prejudiced against African Americans, but
liberals turn out to be more prejudiced against religious Christians.</li>
<li>Conservatives are indeed more biased toward allowing Christian prayers in
schools, but liberals are more biased toward allowing Muslim prayers in
schools.</li>
<li>But just when we need this disinterested forum the most, academia has become
more politicized as well—not more polarized, but more left-wing. Colleges
have always been more liberal than the American population.</li>
<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces
(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and
manpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic
happens, and it fails to make the news.</li>
<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared
with only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but
without data, you would never know it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement of world
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more
fortunate countries to 81.</li>
<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>
<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most
liberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking
countries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist
countries of central Europe.</li>
<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the
idea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over
time.</li>
<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th
century, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car
accident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99
percent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall
to their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less
likely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent
less likely to be killed on the job.</li>
<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human
life. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward
more mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life
virtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and
they constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that
this tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the
stagnation of progress.</li>
<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have
values today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement in Lifestyle
<ul>
<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in
2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the
washing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the
Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children
than stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>
<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty
rate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10
percent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>
<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier
than their helicoptering parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human nature
<ul>
<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those
with meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>
<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones
makes it more meaningful.</li>
<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,
struggle, and worry.</li>
<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are
opened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely
human cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past
and stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of
acquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability
to persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and
efficacy.</li>
<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to
think it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and
helplessness.</li>
<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor
plummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out
of desperation rather than greed.</li>
<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>
<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an
effective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biases
<ul>
<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,
to discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>
<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with
the consequences of their opinions.</li>
<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when
they are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are
after the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>
<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as
much as is feasible.</li>
<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like
it if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the
other—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective
merits.</li>
<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their
beliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you
than to pay attention to those who agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media
<ul>
<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,
feel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>
<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and
they empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their
successes.</li>
<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely
to want a large number of friend.</li>
<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the
1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,
have become any less social.</li>
<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,
unions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal
gatherings and via digital media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tech
<ul>
<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed
to weaponize it.</li>
<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work
to defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>
<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into
preventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of
years of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of
biology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries
<ul>
<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and
regulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western
Europe) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to
live, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human
flourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,
and happiness.</li>
<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries
have gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get
happier still.</li>
<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in
liberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market
freedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>
<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but
what about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in
boring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without
violence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the
former Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cyber Attack
<ul>
<li>The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking
confidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016
American election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a
botnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.</li>
<li>Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weapon
<ul>
<li>The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the
world’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make
lousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,
and citizens of the side that uses them.</li>
<li>The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works
against the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.</li>
<li>Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold
virus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can
shake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy
and kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body
to body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for
cholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish
flu).</li>
<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States
can launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber
aircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a
first strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forecasters
<ul>
<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or
right-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but
misguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event
was to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned
out to be.</li>
<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they
could. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their
speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on
the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not
certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more
readily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>
<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to
experience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for
cognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative
complexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>
<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are
neither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their
abilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as
“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>
<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and
confirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Religions
<ul>
<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are
education, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other
social services.</li>
<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no
religion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or
poverty on the scales.</li>
<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than
stay-at-homes, but</li>
<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is
as charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer
who prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>
<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced
atheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be
fanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of
atheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far
in the 21st.</li>
<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as
“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”
down from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>
<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other
factors constant.</li>
<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,
they stop believing in miracles.</li>
<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>
<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,
the more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who care about you?
<ul>
<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is
meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>
<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws
of the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>
<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan
your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>
<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense
of feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across
billions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is
cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a
responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in
which we all can flourish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Others
<ul>
<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been
lowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>
<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>
<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the
things that happen in the world is that people solve the problems
confronting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><em>Wordsmithing</em> - The making of changes to a text to improve clarity and style.</p>
<p><em>Catastrophize</em> - Worse then it truly is</p>
<p><em>Modicum</em> - Small quantity of valuable thing</p>
<p><em>Emphatic</em> - Forcefully and Clearly</p>
<p><em>Millennials</em> - Those born after 1980</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the
liberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed
it—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong
more often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased
crime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal
numerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our
civilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to
Christian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,
“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this
nation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the
face of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars
was spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge
that was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your
mother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet. Um .
. . Could you install it for us?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Spain was an economic laggard among Western countries, even though Spaniards
were highly schooled, because Spanish education was controlled by the Catholic
Church, and “the children of the masses received only oral instruction in the
Creed, the catechism, and a few simple manual skills. . . . Science,
mathematics, political economy, and secular history were considered too
controversial for anyone but trained theologians.”</p>

<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words.</li>
<li>We all have twice as many female ancestors as male (imagine that all the women who have ever lived have averaged one child. Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>
<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>
<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>
<li>About ourselves
<ul>
<li>Order &amp; Chaos
<ul>
<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>
<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>
<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rules
<ul>
<li>We are rule generators. Humans can’t live without rules.</li>
<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hierarchy of value
<ul>
<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>
<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emotions
<ul>
<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>
<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Women
<ul>
<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>
<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>
<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideologies
<ul>
<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>
<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>
<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meaning
<ul>
<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>
<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why we are not equal?
<ul>
<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>
<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>
<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>
<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why you compare yourself?
<ul>
<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>
<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>
<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>
<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>
<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who are you?
<ul>
<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>
<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>
<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>
<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>
<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>
<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>
<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>
<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>
<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What not to do?
<ul>
<li>Low self-worth people
<ul>
<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>
<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>
<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>
<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How internal critic puts you down?
<ul>
<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>
<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>
<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>
<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequence of remaining silent.
<ul>
<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>
<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>
<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What people do that they don’t think they do?
<ul>
<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>
<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>
<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manipulate the World
<ul>
<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>
<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>
<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>
<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to stop doing?
<ul>
<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>
<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>
<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>
<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>
<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>
<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Children
<ul>
<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>
<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About lies
<ul>
<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>
<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>
<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>
<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>
<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to
<ul>
<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>
<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>
<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women
<ul>
<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>
<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>
<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>
<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>
<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>
<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>
<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>
<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?
<ul>
<li>About Truth
<ul>
<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>
<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>
<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>
<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>
<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>
<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>
<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>
<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Self
<ul>
<li>Why to take care of yourself?
<ul>
<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>
<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>
<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>
<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>
<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to improve yourself.
<ul>
<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>
<li>Speak your mind.</li>
<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>
<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>
<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>
<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Improvement Steps
<ul>
<li>Start with yourself.</li>
<li>Take care with yourself.</li>
<li>Define who you are.</li>
<li>Refine your personality.</li>
<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>
<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to know yourself?
<ul>
<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>
<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>
<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?
<ul>
<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>
<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>
<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>
<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why life is a game?
<ul>
<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>
<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>
<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>
<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>
<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to win?
<ul>
<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>
<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>
<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture
<ul>
<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>
<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To improve your life aim small.
<ul>
<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>
<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>
<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>
<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?
<ul>
<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>
<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>
<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>
<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>
<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>
<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?
<ul>
<li>Tell the truth.</li>
<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listening to other people
<ul>
<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>
<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>
<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>
<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>
<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>
<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>
<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>
<li>Don’t blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>
<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>
<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>
<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>
<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>
<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>
<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>
<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship
<ul>
<li>Why we save people?
<ul>
<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>
<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>
<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>
<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why not help some people?
<ul>
<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>
<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>
<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?
<ul>
<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>
<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>
<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bad Friends
<ul>
<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>
<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>
<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>
<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>
<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>
<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Friends
<ul>
<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>
<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>
<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>
<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>
<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>
<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>
<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>
<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>
<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you. You need to give love before you re</strong>ce<strong>ive it.</strong></li>
<li>When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Culture
<ul>
<li>You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion.</li>
<li>You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.</li>
<li>The crowd is by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world and with the people you disagree with.</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> - Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>
<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>
<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>
<hr>
<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>
<hr>
<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>
<hr>
<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat with only 236 different words, so his editor
bet him he couldn’t write a book with only 50 different words. Dr. Seuss came
back and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s
books of all time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter
until my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed.
But instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try
to channel it into my writing and my drawing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but
then I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade
hardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.</p>
<p>About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel
whole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my
writing, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell
that new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.</p>
<hr>
<p>“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has
admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of
his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized
he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type
as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his
own.</p>

<p>Author: Adam Grant Created time: March 13, 2021 6:21 AM Page No.: 384 Progress:
⭕</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>Giver Vs Taker</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses.
<ul>
<li>Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways
to knock them down a notch.</li>
<li>Takers tend to be <strong>self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person
singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me —versus first-person plural
pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21
percent of CEOs’ first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme
takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of
every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four
were about themselves alone and no one else.</li>
<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in
their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt
entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>
<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms
<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total
shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger
losses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung
for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and
larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.
Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put
their companies in jeopardy.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97">Giver and Taker</a> On the left
side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about
me. A big photo is self-glorifying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than
gunning for them.
<ul>
<li>Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success
of people around them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse
skills, and power.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to
knowledge, expertise, and influence.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of
dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a
favor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they
get what they want. <strong>This faker style of networking</strong> casts the entire
enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make
connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.</li>
<li>When <strong>people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational
information</strong>. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form
of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker
tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as
<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning
bridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>

<hr>
<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored
with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his
computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech
server. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the
music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band
skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>

established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court
female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even
do acrobatics.</li>

<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts.</li>
<li>They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities.</li>
<li>They learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.</li>
<li>The more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example.</li>
<li>Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Learn with Mix things</strong> not a Single thing.</li>
<li>The more likely an expert was to have his or her predictions featured on op-ed pages and television, <strong>the more likely they were always wrong.</strong></li>
<li>The best forecasters view their own ideas as <strong>hypotheses in need of testing.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, <strong>but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crew leadership not as decision making, but as sensemaking.
<ul>
<li>If I make a decision, it is a possession, I take pride in it, I tend to defend it and not listen to those who question it.</li>
<li>If I make sense, then this is more dynamic and I listen and I can change it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dark horses were on the hunt for match quality. “They never look around and say, ‘Oh, I’m going to fall behind, these people started earlier and have more than me at a younger age,’”</p>
<p>Ogas told me.</p>
<p>“They focused on, ‘Here’s who I am at the moment, here are my motivations, here’s what I’ve found I like to do, here’s what I’d like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which of these is the best match right now? And maybe a year from now I’ll switch because I’ll find something better.’”</p>

✔️</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>The best bet is to blindly generate novel ideas and gather more feedback from
fellow creators to hone his vision about which ones might prove useful. As an
investor, you’ll be able to see more clearly, but you’ll still be making
one-eyed gambles.</li>
<li>Don’t change the system rather aimed to earn status by becoming part of the
system and then changing it from within.</li>
<li>Agreeable and Disagreeable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Agreeable- people were happiest in the moments when they doled out compliments
and praise, smiled and laughed with others, expressed affection, reassured
others, and compromised.</li>
<li>Disagreeable- people’s greatest joy when they were criticizing, confronting,
or challenging others.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The fall from low to lower hardly hurts. The fall from the middle to low is
devastating.</li>
<li>Research shows that the mistakes we regret are not errors of commission, But
errors of omission.</li>
<li>Pioneers and Settlers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The pioneers were first movers the initial company to develop or sell a
product.
<ul>
<li>47 percent of the failure rate.</li>
<li>10% of the market share.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The settlers were slower to launch, waiting until the pioneers had c treated a
market before entering.
<ul>
<li>8 percent of the failure rate.</li>
<li>22% of the market share.</li>
<li>Settlers are often branded as copycats, but this stereotype misses the mark.
Instead of conforming to the existing demand, they bide their time until
they’re ready to introduce something new. Slow to enter because they’re
working on revolutionary products, services, or technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of
every four fail because of premature scaling—<strong>making investments that the
market isn’t yet ready to support</strong>.</li>
<li>The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to
rush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.</li>
<li>Conceptual &amp; Experimental innovators</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.
<ul>
<li>Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.</li>
<li>Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.</li>
<li>Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk
copying, themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and
evolving as they go along.
<ul>
<li>Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.</li>
<li>45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.</li>
<li>The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: <strong>instead
of reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering
new one’s</strong>.</li>
<li>:eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate
expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas
from the past.</strong> Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your
imagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your
peripheral vision.</li>
<li>The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more
strongly you identify with an extreme group, <strong>the harder you seek to
differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values</strong>.</li>
<li>Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. <strong>When the overlap in
tactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less
likely</strong>. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have
less to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be
redundant.</li>
<li>You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing
something original that challenges the status quo.</li>
<li>Negative &amp; Ambivalent Relationship</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague
consistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.</li>
<li>Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions
about when that person can actually be trusted.
<ul>
<li>Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative
relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re
the ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet
again, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.</li>
<li>People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started
out negative and then become more positive.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince
them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing
theirs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our
agendas to familiar values that people already hold.</strong></li>
<li>As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals
occasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to
attempt to steal a base.</li>
<li>Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns
believed in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.</li>
<li>An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old
firstborn.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often
coincides with societal expectations.</li>
<li>Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a
cheater.”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person
in the mirror.</li>
<li>But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality
is tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of
Meena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of <strong>Martin Luther King,
Jr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela</strong>.</li>
<li>Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star,
and commitment.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills:
Founders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or
scientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.
<ul>
<li>Failure rates we’re were worse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future
potential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The
individuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular
area, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.
<ul>
<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and
challenging tasks.</li>
<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural
fit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the
company’s values and norms.
<ul>
<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees
and to the organization.</li>
<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in
the organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the
mission.</li>
<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms
was zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>
<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>
<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model
and more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>
<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower
than star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>
<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or
integrating a diverse workforce.</li>
<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too
insular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and
they’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.
As a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more
reliable financial results than their competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their
perspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of
dissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from
people who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>
<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times
higher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the
founder’s original model.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of
the firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on
potential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>
<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the
founder.</li>
<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with
commitment blueprints.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who
reinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers
throw culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates
can improve the culture.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles
against it than in support of it.</li>
<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>
<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the
principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>
<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on
different values or interpret the same values differently.</li>
<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and
<strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act
in the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear
of failing.</li>
<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be
crippled by fear.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and
convert it into motivation.</li>
<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering
every relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables
them to feel a sense of control.</li>
<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the
difficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>
<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature
positive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic
product decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too
optimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention
to potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to
take preventative and corrective actions.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more
terrifying than the negative.</li>
<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>
<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re
not alone.</li>
<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>
<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to
emphasize losses rather than gains.</li>
<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with
the present.</li>
<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation
or revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better
system. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>
<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the
first place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by
people, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to
consider how they can be improved.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>
<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is
incomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or
writing process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give
ideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,
and you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s
also tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they
evaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by
peers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>
<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>
<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from
Lisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to
spend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of
business</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.
Then, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert
them into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>
<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a
monthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones
are worth solving.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do
you think this made her feel?”.</li>
<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Story</h1>
<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href="http://dosomething.org/">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO
Nancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,
because they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.
Employees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have
to explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because
the title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to
contribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just
thirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of
speaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for
delivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades
testing out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the
thousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different
melodies and refrains.</p>
<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a
series of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to
explain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.
Explaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to
explain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.
Considering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize
that some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>
<hr>
<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to
encourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David
Hofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>
<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a
significant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical
professionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent
more soap and gel</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their
early thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,
the vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,
psychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments
to changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a
major influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations
to drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been
influenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their
mentors.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse
workforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the
navy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he
didn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took
on; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and
dedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same
passions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and
cohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your
organization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever
encountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.
Headquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in
investments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its
philosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the
founder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a
word about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any
situation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful
work and build meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees
are hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating
that’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp
modeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the
principles, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and
evaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s
always a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,
to the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for
employees to stay for decades.</p>
<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,
but its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,
both of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.
They’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in
the history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the
combined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>
<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the
Steve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone
special. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a
meeting with an important potential client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50
minutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all
because there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the
outset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a
“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who
attended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A
to F.</p>
<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be
fired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the
country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,
they are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance
by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon
they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to
start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,
pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars
and trucks at a glacial pace.</p>

<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 7:14 PM Page No.: 132
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>A collection of thoughts around re-defining yourself, changing focus, and saying
yes to less</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Focus more on my global friends.</li>
<li>Start comparing to my old self not other people.</li>
<li>Start saying everything is my responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Business points
<ul>
<li>Local Vs Global
<ul>
<li>If you’re local, you focus on your community, doing things in-person. But
this means you have less time to focus on the rest of the world.</li>
<li>If you’re global, you make things for the whole world. But this means you
have less time to be part of your local community.</li>
<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t
see it until we get outside of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Job Vs Art
<ul>
<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing
satisfy your entire life.
<ul>
<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid
stability for part of your day, but then need creative time for
expression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art
to the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then
long for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid
future. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when
factoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a
few years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a
head choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job
your entire life.</li>
<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.
Keep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to get inspiration?
<ul>
<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>
<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>
<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>
<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to start?
<ul>
<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>
<li>If you love something copy it. Nothing is OG.</li>
<li>You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.</li>
<li>Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal
service. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What don’t do?
<ul>
<li>Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action. But
success comes from doing, not declaring.</li>
<li>Use title if you are really doing that.</li>
<li>Don’t announce anything.</li>
<li>Don’t choose a name.</li>
<li>Don’t make a website or an app.</li>
<li>Don’t build a system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What comes with business?
<ul>
<li>You can’t do everything you have prioritize somethings only.</li>
<li>To make money you have to let go your freedom.</li>
<li>Be honest to yourself what you want to pursue.</li>
<li>But when you go against the stereotype, people get confused. Ex: <strong>The
entrepreneur who’s not into money.</strong></li>
<li>You first action wasn’t most honest but it’s answer that you came up
instead of thinking deep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>Little steps can make lot of difference.</li>
<li>Avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate you. They’re not allowed in my life
right now, not even for a minute. No big explanation needed. No compromise.
No favors.</li>
<li>Like blocking this things: Social media comments, Distracting environments,
Discouraging family members &amp; Your email inbox.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effect of decisions
<ul>
<li><strong>Three things to consider when making life-size decisions.</strong>
<ol>
<li>What makes you happy</li>
<li>What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you</li>
<li>What’s useful to others</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Smart and useful (but not happy)
<ul>
<li>Smart and useful isn’t bad. It’s rational, like a machine. But happiness
is the oil. Without it, the friction kills the engine.</li>
<li>This is the stereotype of the strict parent who says, “You will go to the
best school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make
lots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you
and your family.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Happy and smart (but not useful)
<ul>
<li>They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something
that’s really valuable to others.</li>
<li>This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:
always learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be
happy and create the perfect life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Happy and useful (but not smart)
<ul>
<li>But if a graduate’s time could be worth 200 per hour, yet they’re doing
work that locals could do better for10 per hour (and without airfare and
hotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.</li>
<li>This is the stereotype of charity volunteers. After getting expensive
university degrees, they spend years flying to exotic impoverished places
to dig wells and thatch roofs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self Points
<ul>
<li>How to learn?
<ul>
<li>Learning without doing is wasted.</li>
<li>It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do change your mindset?
<ul>
<li>Doubt what I know. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. Require current
proof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.</li>
<li>Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed. What got me
here won’t get me there.</li>
<li>Old ways don’t work anymore. You have to change see beyond your tunnel
view. Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.
<ul>
<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.
If you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and
no responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever
else, you need to realize it and embrace it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could
change your mind soon.
<ul>
<li>I have to smile, thinking about what my former self would say. But the
former self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions
as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just
the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t
define who we are in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the
next-lower one.
<ul>
<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get
it, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that
silver envy. Instead, if you aim to buy the “good enough” thing, it will
keep you in the bronze mindset. Since you’re not comparing to the best,
you’ll feel no need to keep up.</li>
<li>Trying to be the best at a specific skill, it’s good to be dissatisfied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego
<ul>
<li>Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.</li>
<li>I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at
all.</li>
<li>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smart &amp; Stupid
<ul>
<li>Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to find the
real answer, <strong>not the easiest answer.</strong></li>
<li>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. <strong>Jumping
to a conclusion is like quitting a game.</strong> You lose by default.</li>
<li>So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped
thinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to overcome comfort zone?
<ul>
<li>When you’re scared to talk to someone intimidating. You notice you’re
scared. Whatever scares you, go do it.</li>
<li>Once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore! As
you go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and
less in the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think you are below average.
<ul>
<li>Thing people get wrong.
<ul>
<li>Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than
the average cancer patient.</li>
<li>Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average
teachers.</li>
<li>Ninety percent of students think they are more intelligent than the
average student.</li>
<li>Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assume I’m below average.</li>
<li>It serves well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped
thinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thing it is your fault.
<ul>
<li>When you forgive, you’re still assuming that they’re wrong and you’re the
victim.</li>
<li>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged.</li>
<li>People were just playing their part in the situation you helped create.</li>
<li>Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can
learn from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Productivity
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step to improve</p>
<ul>
<li>That one little action changes how you think about yourself.</li>
<li>Having taken that one step, you start to think of yourself as brave, or an
achiever, or a bit of an expert on a subject.</li>
<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel generous, so you start to act
generous, so you become generous.</li>
<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel like a leader, so you start to
act like a leader, so you become a leader.</li>
<li>The world treats you as you treat yourself. Your actions show the world
who you are.</li>
<li>You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So
start by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals</p>
<ul>
<li>If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already. You
wouldn’t wait. Nothing would stop you.</li>
<li>The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. The future doesn’t
exist.</li>
<li>Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment</li>
<li>You have to optimize for one main goal and have to let go others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they really wanted to do it, they would have done it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.</li>
<li>Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present-focused people &amp; Future-focused people.</p>
<p><strong>Present-focused people</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty</li>
<li>Focus on immediate gratification</li>
<li>Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them</li>
<li>Are playful, impulsive, and sensual</li>
<li>Avoid anything boring, difficult, or repetitive</li>
<li>Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time</li>
<li>Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol</li>
<li>Are better at helping others than helping themselves</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future-focused people</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Delay gratification</li>
<li>Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future
goals</li>
<li>Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and
possible futures</li>
<li>Especially love their work</li>
<li>Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams</li>
<li>Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others</li>
<li>Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the
expense of personal relationships, which require a present focus</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No &amp; Yes</p>
<p><strong>No</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It’s an easier decision. Say no to almost everything. This starts to free
your time and mind.</li>
<li>Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have
the space in your life to give it your full attention.</li>
<li>Saying no makes your yes more powerful.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It’s good to say yes when you’re starting out.</li>
<li>Wanting any opportunity, or needing variety.</li>
<li>It’s bad to say yes when you’re overwhelmed, over-committed, or need to
focus.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of effort wasn’t effort at all but just an unnecessary stress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Stupid</strong> - Avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a
conclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.</p>
<p><strong>Smart</strong> - It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.</p>
<p><strong>Long term</strong> - Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years,
then another.</p>
<p><strong>Short term</strong> - assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t
happen.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<hr>
<p>One day, I wrote a blog post sharing what I had learned while switching between
the PHP programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. At the time, my blog
had no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the
record.</p>
<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,
and it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand
comments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>
<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,
something switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They
weren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked
like me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they
had never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,
because they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and
spewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was
funny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>
<hr>
<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the
spotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some
famous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The
richest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve
optimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take
less money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that
deal.</p>
<hr>
<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,
entirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t
socialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business
grow quickly.</p>
<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —
super productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in
Portland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused
globally.</p>
<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to
get fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every
request, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent
most of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore
community.</p>
<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and
unfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two
hours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole
world, including that one person.</p>
<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new
articles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>
<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my
community, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old
company had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.
Customers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they
wished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It
took me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients
a favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most
successful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8
million for thousands of musicians.</p>

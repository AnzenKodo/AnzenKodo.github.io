<li>About Amateurs
<ul>
<li>Why being amateurs are better than Professionals?

<li>Amateurs are willing to try anything.</li>
<li>They can share share anything without worry looking good.</li>
<li>Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing
nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to stay amateurs?
<ul>
<li>For professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s
spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown.</li>
<li>I you feel like being to comfortable then try something new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media
<ul>
<li>
<p>Own Website &amp; Blog with own domain name is more important than Social Media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to start social media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of
what they’re not sharing.</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no
matter how bad they are at first.</li>
<li>Don’t worry, for now, about how you’ll make money or a career off it.</li>
<li>Forget about being an expert or a professional.</li>
<li>Share what you love.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to share in social media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort your content with only so meaningful bits thing left behind.</li>
<li>Make you content into small bits</li>
<li>Share you small bits in different pieces.</li>
<li>Share your influences and what’s inspiring you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to share about projects?</p>

<li>If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods
or share works in progress.</li>
<li>If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product.</li>

<li>When and where it was made?</li>
<li>Why you’re sharing it?</li>
<li>Why people should care about it?</li>
<li>Where people can see some more work like it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give proper credit to inspiration or creater of content you make.</li>
<li>If you don’t know who made then don’t share it.</li>
<li>You give credit because people are lazy they don’t search in google to
find the credated artist.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>What to put on social media?</p>

<li>So don’t post things online that you’re not ready for everyone in the
world to see.</li>
<li>You need feedback but don’t share absolutely everything.</li>
<li>Only put something online if helpful or entertaining.</li>
<li>If you don’t know to put something online or not then put it for only 24 H
and see the response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flow to Stock</p>

<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>John T. Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would
do a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your
poem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?
It’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and
say, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your
life worth?”</p>

<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of
the International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family
were sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate
interest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced
major budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help
people connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said
Hadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day
activities.”</p>
<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>
<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him
set up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,
while performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered
questions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded
music, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his
teeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions
of people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t
normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN
SPACE!”</p>

<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided
“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to
direct Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he
was held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to
die,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .
. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m
going to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>
<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the
throat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy
and life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a
permanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination
didn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer
George Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or
four days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in
it, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to
really have that</p>

<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to
treat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either
scribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward
computer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>
<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to
Facebook, and blogging at <a href="http://rogerebert.com/">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped
out posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about
everything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak
’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his
inevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,
and he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with
the world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Personal Values</h1>
<p>Author: Mark Manson Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 50 Progress:
✔️</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<h3>Good values are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Evidence-based</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>That “cause” is often what we refer to as our “purpose” and finding it is one
of the most important endeavors we can take to enhance our health and
well-being. But our purpose should be sought not merely through what feels
good. It must be considered and reasoned. We must accumulate evidence
supporting it.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Constructive</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is money for why what you value is often not as important as why you
value it. If you value martial arts because you enjoy hurting people, then
that’s a bad value. But if you value it because you are in the military and
want to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.Controllable</p>
<ul>
<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.
Creativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because
you CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a
side effect.</li>
<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,
standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>
<h3>Bad values are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Emotion-based</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions
and are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge
or information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are
generally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term
gains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Destructive</li>
<li>Uncontrollable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up
your life to that thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,
feeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being
alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,
sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>
<h3>How to change values?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into
valuing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite
effect—they double down).</li>
<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes
this contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.
Too much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>
<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The world sucks</li>
<li>We suck</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of
trying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a
few. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving
your best effort.</li>
<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always
need more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will
need more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need
less money.</li>
<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control
whether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You
can always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always
control if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something
you find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>
<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings
or even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>
<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every
aspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with
your father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for
respect.
<ul>
<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>
<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.
<ul>
<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an
adult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>
<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,
because to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you
are obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fault</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to
make them perfect too.</li>
<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>
<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter
whose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big
hole, start climbing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>
<h3>FAIL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad
long-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.
<ul>
<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not
doing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where
pursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is
intrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>
<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who
don’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life
plans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up
a mountain for a molehill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right
reasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to
never love at all.</li>

<p>Author: David Epstein
Created time: March 13, 2021 6:02 AM
Page No.: 354
Progress: ✔️</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts.</li>
<li>They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities.</li>
<li>They learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.</li>
<li>The more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example.</li>
<li>Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Learn with Mix things</strong> not a Single thing.</li>
<li>The more likely an expert was to have his or her predictions featured on op-ed pages and television, <strong>the more likely they were always wrong.</strong></li>
<li>The best forecasters view their own ideas as <strong>hypotheses in need of testing.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, <strong>but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crew leadership not as decision making, but as sensemaking.
<ul>
<li>If I make a decision, it is a possession, I take pride in it, I tend to defend it and not listen to those who question it.</li>
<li>If I make sense, then this is more dynamic and I listen and I can change it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Storys</h1>
<p>Dark horses were on the hunt for match quality. “They never look around and say, ‘Oh, I’m going to fall behind, these people started earlier and have more than me at a younger age,’”</p>
<p>Ogas told me.</p>
<p>“They focused on, ‘Here’s who I am at the moment, here are my motivations, here’s what I’ve found I like to do, here’s what I’d like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which of these is the best match right now? And maybe a year from now I’ll switch because I’ll find something better.’”</p>

<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 7:14 PM Page No.: 132
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>A collection of thoughts around re-defining yourself, changing focus, and saying
yes to less</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Focus more on my global friends.</li>
<li>Start comparing to my old self not other people.</li>
<li>Start saying everything is my responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Business points
<ul>
<li>Local Vs Global
<ul>
<li>If you’re local, you focus on your community, doing things in-person. But
this means you have less time to focus on the rest of the world.</li>
<li>If you’re global, you make things for the whole world. But this means you
have less time to be part of your local community.</li>
<li>Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t
see it until we get outside of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Job Vs Art
<ul>
<li>Do something for love and something for money. Don’t try to make one thing
satisfy your entire life.
<ul>
<li>Each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other. You get paid
stability for part of your day, but then need creative time for
expression. So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable art
to the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then
long for some stability again. Each half is a remedy for the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About the job: Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid
future. Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best when
factoring in the required training. You’ll probably need to study for a
few years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded. This is a
head choice, not a heart choice, since you’re not trying to make your job
your entire life.</li>
<li>About your art: Pursue it seriously. Take lessons. Make weekly progress.
Keep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to get inspiration?
<ul>
<li>Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work.</li>
<li>Your work, itself, is the inspiration.</li>
<li>Inspiration is not receiving information.</li>
<li>Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to start?
<ul>
<li>Before you start think about how it could end.</li>
<li>If you love something copy it. Nothing is OG.</li>
<li>You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.</li>
<li>Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal
service. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What don’t do?
<ul>
<li>Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action. But
success comes from doing, not declaring.</li>
<li>Use title if you are really doing that.</li>
<li>Don’t announce anything.</li>
<li>Don’t choose a name.</li>
<li>Don’t make a website or an app.</li>
<li>Don’t build a system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What comes with business?
<ul>
<li>You can’t do everything you have prioritize somethings only.</li>
<li>To make money you have to let go your freedom.</li>
<li>Be honest to yourself what you want to pursue.</li>
<li>But when you go against the stereotype, people get confused. Ex: <strong>The
entrepreneur who’s not into money.</strong></li>
<li>You first action wasn’t most honest but it’s answer that you came up
instead of thinking deep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>Little steps can make lot of difference.</li>
<li>Avoid anyone who doesn’t rejuvenate you. They’re not allowed in my life
right now, not even for a minute. No big explanation needed. No compromise.
No favors.</li>
<li>Like blocking this things: Social media comments, Distracting environments,
Discouraging family members &amp; Your email inbox.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effect of decisions
<ul>
<li><strong>Three things to consider when making life-size decisions.</strong>
<ol>
<li>What makes you happy</li>
<li>What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you</li>
<li>What’s useful to others</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Smart and useful (but not happy)
<ul>
<li>Smart and useful isn’t bad. It’s rational, like a machine. But happiness
is the oil. Without it, the friction kills the engine.</li>
<li>This is the stereotype of the strict parent who says, “You will go to the
best school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make
lots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you
and your family.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Happy and smart (but not useful)
<ul>
<li>They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something
that’s really valuable to others.</li>
<li>This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:
always learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be
happy and create the perfect life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Happy and useful (but not smart)
<ul>
<li>But if a graduate’s time could be worth 200 per hour, yet they’re doing
work that locals could do better for10 per hour (and without airfare and
hotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.</li>
<li>This is the stereotype of charity volunteers. After getting expensive
university degrees, they spend years flying to exotic impoverished places
to dig wells and thatch roofs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self Points
<ul>
<li>How to learn?
<ul>
<li>Learning without doing is wasted.</li>
<li>It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do change your mindset?
<ul>
<li>Doubt what I know. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. Require current
proof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.</li>
<li>Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed. What got me
here won’t get me there.</li>
<li>Old ways don’t work anymore. You have to change see beyond your tunnel
view. Solution: <strong>The solution is deliberate unlearning.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t pursue someone else dreams instead pursue your owns.
<ul>
<li>For example, if you want to make a lot of money, you need to admit that.
If you want to be famous, you need to pursue that. If you want freedom and
no responsibilities, or want to learn as much as possible, or whatever
else, you need to realize it and embrace it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be careful when you say you like or dislike something, because you could
change your mind soon.
<ul>
<li>I have to smile, thinking about what my former self would say. But the
former self is not always right. We shouldn’t preserve our first opinions
as if they reflect our pure, untarnished, true nature. They’re often just
the result of inexperience or a temporary phase. Old opinions shouldn’t
define who we are in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of comparing up to the next-higher situation, compare down to the
next-lower one.
<ul>
<li>If you aim to buy “the best” thing, you may feel like gold when you get
it, but when the new “best” thing comes out next year, you’ll feel that
silver envy. Instead, if you aim to buy the “good enough” thing, it will
keep you in the bronze mindset. Since you’re not comparing to the best,
you’ll feel no need to keep up.</li>
<li>Trying to be the best at a specific skill, it’s good to be dissatisfied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ego
<ul>
<li>Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.</li>
<li>I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at
all.</li>
<li>Actions, not words, reveal our real values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Smart &amp; Stupid
<ul>
<li>Being smart means thinking things through. It means trying to find the
real answer, <strong>not the easiest answer.</strong></li>
<li>Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. <strong>Jumping
to a conclusion is like quitting a game.</strong> You lose by default.</li>
<li>So when someone says, “They’re so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped
thinking. They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to overcome comfort zone?
<ul>
<li>When you’re scared to talk to someone intimidating. You notice you’re
scared. Whatever scares you, go do it.</li>
<li>Once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore! As
you go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and
less in the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think you are below average.
<ul>
<li>Thing people get wrong.
<ul>
<li>Ninety-six percent of cancer patients claim to be in better health than
the average cancer patient.</li>
<li>Ninety-four percent of professors say they are better-than-average
teachers.</li>
<li>Ninety percent of students think they are more intelligent than the
average student.</li>
<li>Ninety-three percent of drivers say they are safer-than-average drivers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assume I’m below average.</li>
<li>It serves well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I’ve stopped
thinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thing it is your fault.
<ul>
<li>When you forgive, you’re still assuming that they’re wrong and you’re the
victim.</li>
<li>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged.</li>
<li>People were just playing their part in the situation you helped create.</li>
<li>Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can
learn from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Productivity
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step to improve</p>
<ul>
<li>That one little action changes how you think about yourself.</li>
<li>Having taken that one step, you start to think of yourself as brave, or an
achiever, or a bit of an expert on a subject.</li>
<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel generous, so you start to act
generous, so you become generous.</li>
<li>You do just one thing that makes you feel like a leader, so you start to
act like a leader, so you become a leader.</li>
<li>The world treats you as you treat yourself. Your actions show the world
who you are.</li>
<li>You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So
start by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals</p>
<ul>
<li>If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already. You
wouldn’t wait. Nothing would stop you.</li>
<li>The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. The future doesn’t
exist.</li>
<li>Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment</li>
<li>You have to optimize for one main goal and have to let go others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they really wanted to do it, they would have done it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.</li>
<li>Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it’s really true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present-focused people &amp; Future-focused people.</p>
<p><strong>Present-focused people</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pursue pleasure, excitement, and novelty</li>
<li>Focus on immediate gratification</li>
<li>Especially appreciate life, nature, and the people around them</li>
<li>Are playful, impulsive, and sensual</li>
<li>Avoid anything boring, difficult, or repetitive</li>
<li>Get fully immersed in the moment and lose track of time</li>
<li>Are more likely to use drugs and alcohol</li>
<li>Are better at helping others than helping themselves</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future-focused people</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Delay gratification</li>
<li>Are driven with self-discipline because they vividly see their future
goals</li>
<li>Tend to live in their minds, picturing other selves, scenarios, and
possible futures</li>
<li>Especially love their work</li>
<li>Exercise, invest, and go for preventative health exams</li>
<li>Are better at helping themselves, but worse at helping others</li>
<li>Are more likely to be successful in their careers, but often at the
expense of personal relationships, which require a present focus</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No &amp; Yes</p>
<p><strong>No</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It’s an easier decision. Say no to almost everything. This starts to free
your time and mind.</li>
<li>Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have
the space in your life to give it your full attention.</li>
<li>Saying no makes your yes more powerful.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It’s good to say yes when you’re starting out.</li>
<li>Wanting any opportunity, or needing variety.</li>
<li>It’s bad to say yes when you’re overwhelmed, over-committed, or need to
focus.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of effort wasn’t effort at all but just an unnecessary stress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Stupid</strong> - Avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a
conclusion is like quitting a game. You lose by default.</p>
<p><strong>Smart</strong> - It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.</p>
<p><strong>Long term</strong> - Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years,
then another.</p>
<p><strong>Short term</strong> - assuming that if you don’t do all the things now, they won’t
happen.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<hr>
<p>One day, I wrote a blog post sharing what I had learned while switching between
the PHP programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. At the time, my blog
had no readers, so I didn’t think anyone would see it. I just wrote it for the
record.</p>
<p>But when I woke up the next morning, my post was all over the tech news sites,
and it was like I had insulted everyone’s religion. There were over a thousand
comments saying that I was a complete idiot and a terrible programmer.</p>
<p>At first I was upset and insulted, like anyone would be. Then, luckily,
something switched in my head and I realized the most important point: They
weren’t talking about me. They were talking about a cardboard cutout that looked
like me. A little online avatar that has the same name as me, but is not me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be offended when they said I was a terrible programmer, because they
had never seen my code. I couldn’t be offended when they said I was an idiot,
because they didn’t know me. They had read a few paragraphs of an article and
spewed some insults. Their reactions had nothing to do with the real me.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was like watching a little videogame character get attacked. It was
funny to watch, part of the game, and not personal at all.</p>
<hr>
<p>One way to get famous is to let others make more money, while you take the
spotlight. I learned this while living in Los Angeles, when I got to know some
famous Hollywood actors and realized they’re not as rich as you’d think. The
richest people in Hollywood are the ones you’ve never heard of, because they’ve
optimized their careers for money. They know that others are willing to take
less money in return for more fame, so they profit from the other side of that
deal.</p>
<hr>
<p>I lived in Woodstock, New York for three years. There I started my company,
entirely online. I never met anyone in Woodstock. I just lived there, but didn’t
socialize there. My attention was focused globally, which helped my business
grow quickly.</p>
<p>Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for three years. I worked every waking hour —
super productive. I made great friends worldwide, but I never hung out in
Portland. It was just my place to work and sleep. My attention was still focused
globally.</p>
<p>Then I lived in Singapore for three years and decided to do the opposite — to
get fully involved in my local community. I had an open door, said yes to every
request, met with hundreds of people, and went to every event possible. I spent
most of my time talking with people, and really got to know the Singapore
community.</p>
<p>But something felt wrong. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and
unfulfilled. Two hours spent with one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two
hours I could have spent making something that could be useful to the whole
world, including that one person.</p>
<p>Then people in America started emailing to ask why I’d been so silent. No new
articles? No new projects? Nothing?</p>
<p>So there’s the trade-off. When I’m local-focused, I may be useful to my
community, but I’m not being as useful to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So I’m finally admitting: I’m not local.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used to believe that everything I did had to be 100 percent original. My old
company had a competitor that offered credit card machines to musicians.
Customers would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they
wished we had it, too. But copying the competitor seemed out of the question. It
took me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that I’d be doing my clients
a favor if I imitated that idea. So I copied it, and it was one of the most
successful things I ever did. Those little credit card machines made over $8
million for thousands of musicians.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Your Music and People</h1>
<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 9:01 PM Page No.: 146
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>A philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate,
resourceful, and connected.</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make database of people &amp; and how often I should contact them.</li>
<li>Build some persona for people to look up to.</li>
<li>Never give to I am contacting someone.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>How to use friends database?
<ul>
<li>Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.</li>
<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>
<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>
<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have
their correct info.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Normal World &amp; Business World
<ul>
<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they
don’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a
total loser.</li>
<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,
you’re a loser!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to be cool?
<ul>
<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal
boring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had
the courage.</li>
<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but
it’s considerate and part of your art.</li>
<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only
great at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>
<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them
curious.</li>
<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme
character. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About People
<ul>
<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>
<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a
friend. That’s how things are done</li>
<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that
thing is popular.</li>
<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with
your existing contacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business
<ul>
<li>How beat competitor?
<ul>
<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>
<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>
<li>Play a completely different game.</li>
<li>Be radically opposite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters
<ul>
<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.
Make sure they stick together as a group.</li>
<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not
yourself. Make it fun to join.</li>
<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are
having.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been
done.
<ul>
<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use
Amazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not
be able to imagine that niche without you.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your
attention</li>
<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that
it’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>
<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>
<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,
competition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,
being a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that
you’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate
to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>
<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was
completely ignored.</p>
<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d
received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a
second inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>
<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the
chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it
in a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare
time.</p>
<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the
third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a
conference.</p>
<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing
problem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to
get the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the
publisher.</p>
<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for
permission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they
contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>
<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>
<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>
<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They
love it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,
“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on
music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and
tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”
Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing
their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,
and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious
and overwhelming.</p>

<p>Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat with only 236 different words, so his editor
bet him he couldn’t write a book with only 50 different words. Dr. Seuss came
back and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s
books of all time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter
until my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed.
But instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try
to channel it into my writing and my drawing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but
then I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade
hardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.</p>
<p>About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel
whole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my
writing, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell
that new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.</p>
<hr>
<p>“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has
admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of
his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized
he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type
as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his
own.</p>

    <title>an open lette to open minded progressives</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Points</h2>
<p>There is one difference, though. To be a Catholic, you have to have faith, because no one has ever seen the Holy Ghost. To be a progressive, you have to have trust, because you believe that your worldview accurately reflects the real world—as experienced not just by your own small eyes, but by humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>None of them hates Washington as a whole. So they can never unite to destroy it, and the whole machine is stable. See how beautiful this is? By separating voters into two competing but cooperating parties, neither of which can destroy the other, the two-party system creates a government which will survive indefinitely, no matter how much happier its citizens might be without it.</p>
<h2>Sentences</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>And the world changed. Before the 1960s, colonial governments and companies fought malaria because their officials often lived in remote outposts like Nigeria’s hill stations and Vietnam’s Marble Mountains. Independence movements led to freedom, but also often to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care.</strong></p>
<p>What we see here is that independence movements—which the writer clearly believes are a good thing—led to some very concrete and very, very awful results, in addition to this curious abstraction—freedom. Clearly, whatever freedom means in this particular context, it’s such a great positive that even when you add it to civil war, poverty, corrupt government and the collapse of medical care, the result still exceeds zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And what does it mean for a government to be “free,” anyway? Is the government of North Korea “free?” What about ExxonMobil? Or the Democratic Party? I have a fairly good understanding of what it means for a human being to be “free.” When it comes to an organization, especially one which claims to be a “government,” I’m quite without a clue.</p>

Progress: ✔️</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start teaching someone something and that you business starts.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Clients of Your Business
<ul>
<li>The Problem with big clients like Google, Microsoft &amp; Apple.
<ul>
<li>You have to custom-tailor your product to please a very few specific people.</li>
<li>Those people might change their minds or leave the company.</li>
<li>Whom are you really working for? Are you self-employed or is this client your boss?</li>
<li>If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.</li>
<li>By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose wants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good thing about small clients.
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to change what you do to please one client; you need to please only the majority (or yourself).</li>
<li>If one client needs to leave, it’s OK; you can sincerely wish her well.</li>
<li>Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).</li>
<li>You hear hundreds of people’s opinions and stay in touch with what the majority of your clients want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes happy &amp; fulfilling.</li>
<li>When you are at something great you don’t feel something big going to happen.</li>
<li>You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.</li>
<li>Business improvement.
<ul>
<li>Customers satisfaction.
<ul>
<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</li>
<li>Make every decision even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone according to what’s best for your customers.</li>
<li>If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important things to remember.
<ul>
<li>Don’t let other people play with your fear. Like Saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios. Those are just sales tactics.</li>
<li>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</li>
<li>Don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>
<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. <strong>It’s a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.</strong></li>
<li>You don’t need something big to improve the business sometimes it’s little things that’s add up.</li>
<li>People remember you more for the smile that you put on there face then fancy business stuff.</li>
<li>Always prepare for 2x because anytime it can come.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Self-Employed VS Business Owner
<ul>
<li>Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles.</li>
<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solve problems
<ul>
<li>Before trusting someone verify that they can do the job.</li>
<li>Why businesses keep problems around? (Like- Nord VPN)
→A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.</li>
<li>If the company has a problem with your decisions then explain your thought process and philosophy.</li>
<li>If you are an owner of the company you can be anything. And if don’t feel like doing something then give the role to someone who loves doing that role.</li>
<li>Don’t freedom but don’t give too much that they can overturn you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start now. No funding needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal improvement.
<ul>
<li>Don’t follow other people path without making your own path.</li>
<li>Don’t spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them you should want.</li>
<li>If present is worse than past, then move back and restart improving where things are good.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.</li>
<li>Doing work yourself is inefficient but it is what make it so joyful in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derek Sivers philosophies of Business.
<ul>
<li>Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.</li>
<li>Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.</li>
<li>When you make a company, you make a utopia. It’s where you design your perfect world.</li>
<li>Never do anything just for the money.</li>
<li>Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.</li>
<li>Your business plan is moot. You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.</li>
<li>Starting with no money is an advantage. You don’t need money to start helping people.</li>
<li>You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.</li>
<li>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</li>
<li>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterward and the whole party marched down the 6th. I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your picture is on our wall as “Customer of the Year.” We’re all exhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to <a href="http://cdbaby.com/">CDBABY.COM</a>!! That one silly e-mail, sent out with every order, has been so loved</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That one silly e-mail, sent out with every order, has been so loved that if you search Google for “private CD Baby jet,” you’ll get almost twenty thousand results. Each one is somebody who got the email and loved it enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers. When you’re thinking of how to make your business</p>
<hr>
<p>We answered our phone within two rings, always 7am to 10pm, seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>

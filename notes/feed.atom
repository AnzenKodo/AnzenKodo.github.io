    <id>/notes/Programming/android/Viva-6S.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>MAD VIVA QUESTION</h1>
<p>(thk to SaturoGojoo,AK,NEWBIEN00B)</p>
<h2>1) What is android?</h2>
<p>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
<h2>2) Enlist Features of android?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Beautiul UI</li>
<li>Connectivity</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Multi-Touch</li>
<li>Multi-Tasking</li>
<li>Multi-Language</li>
<li>Resizable widgets</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Media Support</li>
<li>Web Browser</li>
</ul>
<h2>3) Explain android architecture?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Android architecture contains different number of components to support any android device needs. Android software contains an open-source Linux Kernel having collection of number of C/C++ libraries which are exposed through an application framework services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main components of android architecture are following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Applications is the top layer of android architecture. The pre-installed applications like home, contacts, camera, etc and third party applications will be installed on this layer only.</li>
<li><strong>Application framework:</strong> Application Framework provides several important classes which are used to create an Android application.</li>
<li><strong>Application runtime:</strong> Android Runtime environment contains components like core libraries and the Dalvik virtual machine(DVM).</li>
<li><strong>Platform libraries:</strong> The Platform Libraries includes various C/C++ core libraries and Java based libraries such as Media, Graphics, OpenGL etc. to provide a support for android development.</li>
<li><strong>Linux Kernel:</strong> The linux kernel manages all the available drivers such as display drivers, camera drivers, audio drivers, etc. which are required during the runtime.</li>
</ol>
<h2>4) Explain android sdk?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Android software development kit(SDK)  allows developers to create applications for the Android platform. The Android SDK is the most important software of Android which is installed.</li>
<li>The Android SDK provides to test application API libraries and emulator documentation sample code developer tools and tutorials which helps us to build and test the debug apps from Android.</li>
<li>Android SDK provides the tools and application programming interface(API)  for developers to create applications on the Android platform using Java programming language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5) What is Android AVD?</h2>
<ul>
<li>An AVD is an emulator configuration that enables to modules an actual device
by calling hardware and software option to be emulated by the Android
emulator.</li>
<li>The AVD manager is an interface that we can launch from android studio which
helps us to create and manage AVD.</li>
<li>An AVD contains hardware profile, system image, storage area, skin and other
properties.</li>
<li>AVD contains emulator for Wear OS, TV, Mobile Phones, Tables, Automotive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardware profile</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hardware profile defines the characteristics of a device as shipped from the
factory of a device as shipped from the factory.</li>
<li>The AVD manager comes preloaded with certain hardware profile such as Pixel
device and we can define or customize the hardware profile as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>System image</h3>
<ul>
<li>A system image labelled with Google API includes access to Google Play
services.</li>
<li>A system image Labelled with Google Play logo in the Play Store includes the
Google Play Store apps and can access to the Google Play Services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storage Area</h3>
<ul>
<li>The AVD has dedicated storage area on our development machine.</li>
<li>It stores the devices data such as installed apps and settings, as well as
emulated and SD cards.</li>
<li>If needed we can use the AVD manager to wipe user data so that the devices has
the same data as if it was a new device.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6) What is emulator?</h2>
<p>The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer so that you can test your application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device.</p>
<h2>7) Difference between JVM and dVM?</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>JVM</th>
<th>DVM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>JVM supports multiple OS</td>
<td>DVM supports only Android Operating system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JVM forms separate classes in separate <code>.class</code> byte code files.</td>
<td>DVM forms multiple class in <code>.dex</code> byte code file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is based on stack based virtual machine architecture.</td>
<td>It is based on register based virtual machine architecture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JVM runs on more memory</td>
<td>DVM runs on less memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The executable format of JVM is JAR.</td>
<td>The executable format of DVM is APK.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JVM has different constant pools.</td>
<td>DVM has common constant pool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It runs <code>.class</code> byte code directly.</td>
<td>The <code>.class</code> byte codes are optimize to .odex format before executing in DVM.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>8) What are activities?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Activities dictate the UI and handles the user interaction to the smart phone screen.</li>
<li>Activities represent a single screen that user interact.</li>
</ol>
<h2>9) What are services?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A service is an application component which runs in the background.</li>
<li>There are three types of service in Android:</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foreground service</h3>
<ul>
<li>A foreground service performs some operation that is noticeable to the user.</li>
<li>For example, an audio app would use a foreground service to play an audio track.</li>
<li>Foreground services must display a Notification. Foreground services continue running even when the user isn’t interacting with the app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backgroud Service**</h3>
<ul>
<li>A background service performs an operation that isn’t directly noticed by the user.</li>
<li>For example, if an app used a service to compact its storage, that would usually be a background service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bound Service</h3>
<ul>
<li>A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService().</li>
<li>A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, receive results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC).</li>
</ul>
<h2>10) What are intents(<code>Implict</code> and <code>explicit</code> intent)?</h2>
<h3>Implicit intent</h3>
<p>The implicit intent is the intent where instead of defining the exact components, you define the action that you want to perform for different activities.</p>
<h3>Explicit intent</h3>
<p>An explicit intent is an intent where you explicitly define the component that needs to be called by Android System. An explicit intent is one that you use to launch a specific app component, such s a particular activity or service in your app.</p>
<h2>11) Explain main Activity file ,manifest and layout file?</h2>
<p><strong>MainActivity file</strong>
The main activity. Java file is automatically kept in this folder by Android studio all the classes will be available here and Android studio will even bundle together the package so that we can work with the file without having to go through all the folders.</p>
<p><strong>Manifest file</strong>
It contains an Android manifest.xml file that is generated by Android studio when we create a project. This file contains the configuration parameters of a project such as Permission services and additional libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Layout file</strong>
Layout specifies the various widgets to be used in the UI and the relationships between such widgets and their containers. Layout files are stored in “res-&gt; layout” in the Android application.</p>
<h2>12) What are different types of UI compents?</h2>
<p><strong>TextView</strong>
TextView is a UI Component that displays the text to the user on their Display Screen.
<strong>EditText</strong>
EditText is a user interface control that allows the users to enter some text.
<strong>Button</strong>
This is a UI that is used to perform some action as soon as the user clicks on it.
<strong>ProgressBar</strong>
Progress bars are used to show progress of a task. For example, when you are uploading or downloading something from the internet, it is better to show the progress of download/upload to the user. In android there is a class called Progress Dialog that allows you to create progress bar.</p>
<h2>13) What are Layouts (<code>LinearLayout</code>, <code>AbsoluteLayout</code>, <code>TableLayout</code>, <code>FrameLayout</code>, <code>RelativeLayout</code>)?</h2>
<p><strong>LinearLayout</strong> is a view group that aligns all children in a single direction, vertically or horizontally.
<strong>AbsoluteLayout</strong> enables us to specify the exact location of its children.
<strong>TableLayout</strong> is a view that groups views into rows and columns.
<strong>RelativeLayout</strong> is a view group that displays child views in relative positions.
<strong>FrameLayout</strong> is a placeholder on screen that we can use to display a single view.</p>
<h2>14) Define: <code>textview</code>, <code>Edittextview</code>, <code>Button</code>, <code>Image button</code>, <code>checkbox</code>(attributes and methods)?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TextView</strong> - This control is used to display text to the user.</li>
<li><strong>EditTextView</strong> - EditText is a predefined subclass of TextView that includes rich editing capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Button</strong> - A push-button that can be pressed, or clicked, by the user to perform an action.</li>
<li><strong>ImageButton</strong> - An ImageButton is an AbsoluteLayout which enables you to specify the exact location of its children. This shows a button with an image (instead of text) that can be pressed or clicked by the user.</li>
<li><strong>CheckBox</strong> - An on/off switch that can be toggled by the user. You should use check box when presenting users with a group of selectable options that are not mutually exclusive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>15) Explain <code>listview</code>, <code>gridview</code>, <code>imageview</code>, <code>scrollview</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ListView</strong> - List of scrollable items can be displayed in Android using ListView. It helps you to displaying the data in the form of a scrollable list.</li>
<li><strong>GridView</strong> - It is a view group that display items in two dimensional scrolling grid (rows and columns), the grid items are not necessarily predetermined but they are automatically inserted to the layout using a ListAdapter.</li>
<li><strong>ImageView</strong> - It is used to display an image file in application.</li>
<li><strong>Scrollview</strong> - It is a view group that is used to make vertically scrollable views. A scroll view contains a single direct child only.</li>
</ul>
<h2>16) What is toast explain with example?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Toast is used to display information for a period of time.</li>
<li>It contains a message to be displayed quickly and disappears after specified period of time.</li>
<li>It does not block the user interaction.</li>
<li>Example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml=">Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),&quot;Hello Javatpoint&quot;,Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
</code></pre>
<h2>17) Explain activity lifecycle?</h2>
<!-- Android Activity Lifecycle is controlled by 7 methods of android.app.Activity class.
- The android Activity is the subclass of ContextThemeWrapper class.
- An activity is the single screen in android. It is like window or frame of Java.
- By the help of activity, you can place all your UI components or widgets in a single screen.

![Activity Lifecycle Image](https://i.imgur.com/VKu9fbr.png)-->
<ul>
<li><strong>7 lifecycle methods of android activity.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>onCreate</strong> - called when activity is first created.</li>
<li><strong>onStart</strong> - called when activity is becoming visible to the user.</li>
<li><strong>onResume</strong> - called when activity will start interacting with the user.</li>
<li><strong>onPause</strong> - called when activity is not visible to the user.</li>
<li><strong>onStop</strong> - called when activity is no longer visible to the user.</li>
<li><strong>onRestart</strong> - called after your activity is stopped, prior to start.</li>
<li><strong>onDestroy</strong> - called before the activity is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>18) Explain broadcast receivers?</h2>
<p>Broadcast Receivers simply respond to broadcast messages from other applications or from the system itself. These messages are sometime called events or intents.</p>
<h3>Creating the Broadcast Receiver</h3>
<p>A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of Broadcast Receiver class and overriding the <code>onReceive()</code> method where each message is received as an Intent object parameter.</p>
<h3>Registering Broadcast Receiver</h3>
<p>An application listens for specific broadcast intents by registering a broadcast receiver in AndroidManifest.xml file. Consider we are going to register MyReceiver for system generated event <code>ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED</code> which is fired by the system once the Android system has completed the boot process.</p>
<h2>19) Explain content provider?</h2>
<p>Android system allows the content provider to store the application data in several ways. Users can manage to store the application data like images, audio, videos, and personal contact information by storing them in SQLite Database, in files, or even on a network. In order to share the data, content providers have certain permissions that are used to grant or restrict the rights to other applications to interfere with the data.</p>
<h2>20) What is sensors?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most Android-powered devices have built-in sensors that measure motion, orientation, and various environmental conditions.</li>
<li>These sensors are capable of providing raw data with high precision and accuracy, and are useful if you want to monitor three-dimensional device movement or positioning, or you want to monitor changes in the ambient environment near a device.</li>
<li>There are three type of sensors in android:</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mostion sensors</h3>
<p>These sensors measure acceleration forces and rotational forces along three axes. This category includes accelerometers, gravity sensors, gyroscopes, and rotational vector sensors.</p>
<h3>Environmental sensors</h3>
<p>These sensors measure various environmental parameters, such as ambient air temperature and pressure, illumination, and humidity. This category includes barometers, photometers, and thermometers.</p>
<h3>Position sensors</h3>
<p>These sensors measure the physical position of a device. This category includes orientation sensors and magnetometers.</p>
<h2>21) What is location based services?</h2>
<p><strong>Location Based Services:</strong> Creating the Project, Getting the Maps API Key, Displaying the Map, Displaying the Zoom Control, Navigating to a Specific Location, Adding Markers, Getting Location,Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding, Getting Location Data, Monitoring Location.</p>
<h2>22) What is Geo code and reverse Geo code?</h2>
<h3>Geo code</h3>
<p>Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.</p>
<h3>Reverse Geo code</h3>
<p>Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.</p>

    <id>/notes/Programming/database/er-diagram/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of different
data using conventions that describe how these data are related to each other.</p>
<p>Example of ER Diagram:</p>
<figure data-type="image"><img src="./ER.svg" alt="ER Diagram" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></figure>
<p>In the diagram, the elements inside rectangles are called entities while the
items inside diamonds denote the relationships between entities.</p>
<p>In the diagram, the elements inside rectangles are called entities while the
items inside diamonds denote the relationships between entities.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Entity</h3>
<ul>
<li>An entity can be a person, place, event, or object that is relevant to given
system.</li>
<li>For Example, a school system may include student, teacher, major courses,
subject, fees, and other items.</li>
<li>Entites are represented in ER diagrams by a rectangles and named using
singular nouns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weak Entity</h3>
<ul>
<li>A weak entity is an entity that depends on teh existence of another entity.</li>
<li>A weak entity is represented in a database by a separated table, but it does
not have a primary key of its own.</li>
<li>It relies on the primary key of the entity on which it depends.</li>
<li>Example:
<ul>
<li>Consider a databse of orders placed by customers at a retail store.
“customer” entity might be the identifying entity, while the “order” entity
is the weak entity. Each order is associated with specific customer, and the
customer’s primary key (e.g. a customer ID) is used as the primary key for
the order as well. This means that the order cannot be uniquely identified
without also specifying the customer to which it belongs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The single identifying entity can have multiple weak entities associated with
it.</li>
<li>Diagram:<pre><code>+---------+      +--------------+
|         |      |+------------+|
| Orders  |------||Orders Items||
|         |      |+------------+|
+---------+      +--------------+
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attribute</h3>
<ul>
<li>An attributes is a characterstic or property of an entity.</li>
<li>Attributes are represented as columns in a database table, with each row
representing a single entity and each column representing an attribute of that
entity.</li>
<li>Example: A “customer” table might include attributes such as “name”,
“address,” and “phone number,” with each attribute storing information about a
perticular customer.</li>
<li>There are two types of attributes:
<ul>
<li>Multivalued Attribute</li>
<li>Derived Attribute</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multivalued Attribute</h4>
<ul>
<li>If an attribute can have more than one value it is called an multivalued
attribute.</li>
<li>It is important to note that this is different to an attribute having it own
attributes.</li>
<li>Example: A “customer” entity can have multiple “phone_numbers” values.</li>
<li>Diagram: <img src="./Multivalued-Attribute.svg" alt="Multivalued Attribute Diagram"></li>
</ul>
<h4>Derived Attribute</h4>
<ul>
<li>An attribute based on another attribute.</li>
<li>Example: “Age” can be derived from “Date of birth”.</li>
<li>Diagram: <img src="./Derived-Attribute.svg" alt="Derived Attribute Diagram"></li>
</ul>
<h3>Relationship</h3>
<ul>
<li>A relationship describes how entities interact.</li>
<li>Example: The entity “carpenter” may be related to the entity “table” by the
relationship “builds” or “makes”.</li>
<li>Relationships are represented by diamond shapes and are labeled using verbs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recursive Relationship</h4>
<ul>
<li>The same entity participates more than once in the relationship.</li>
<li>Example: An employee can be a supervisor and be supervised, so there is a
recursive relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extended Features</h2>
<h3>Generalization</h3>
<ul>
<li>A generalization hierarchy is a form of abstraction that specifies that two or
more entities that share common attributes can be generalized into a
higher-level entity type called a super type or generic entity.</li>
<li>The lower level of entities becomes the subtypes, or categories, to the super
type. Subtypes are dependent entities.</li>
<li>Example: Account is the higher-level entity set and saving account and current
account are lower-level entity sets.</li>
<li>Diagram: <img src="./Generalization.webp" alt="Generalization Diagram"></li>
</ul>
<h3>Specialization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Specialization is the process of taking subsets of the higher-level entity set
to form lower-level entity sets.</li>
<li>It is a process of defining a set of subclasses of an entity type, which is
called the super class of the specialization.</li>
<li>The process of defining subclass is based on the basis of some distinguish
characteristics of the entities in the super class.</li>
<li>Diagram: <img src="./Specialization.webp" alt="Specialization Diagram"></li>
</ul>
<h3>Aggregration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aggregration is a process when relation between two entities is treated as a
single entity.</li>
<li>Example: The relationship between Center and Course together, is acting as an
Entity, which is in relationship with another entity Visitor.</li>

    <id>/notes/Programming/data-structure/tree/decision-tree.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure that is used to make a
decision or prediction based on multiple conditions. It is a supervised learning
algorithm, which means that it is trained on a labeled dataset, where the
correct output is already known.</p>
<p>The decision tree algorithm works by starting at the root node and asking a
series of questions based on the features of the data. Each question splits the
data into two branches, and the algorithm continues to ask questions and split
the data until it reaches a leaf node, which represents a prediction or
decision.</p>
<p>The goal of the decision tree algorithm is to create a tree that accurately
predicts the target variable based on the features of the data. The accuracy of
the prediction is determined by how well the tree is able to classify the
training data.</p>
<p>Decision trees are often used for classification tasks, such as determining
whether a given email is spam or not, or for regression tasks, such as
predicting the price of a house based on its features. They are also commonly
used in data mining and machine learning applications.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2023-01-11T08:38:07.702Z</updated>
    <id>/notes/Programming/data-structure/tree/threaded-binary-tree.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A threaded binary tree is a binary tree in which the nodes are threaded, or
connected, in a way that allows them to be traversed efficiently. In a threaded
binary tree, each node has a left and right pointer, just like in a regular
binary tree. However, if the left or right pointer of a node is null, it is
replaced with a thread that points to the in-order predecessor or successor of
the node, respectively. This allows the tree to be traversed in-order without
the need to follow a null pointer and backtrack, making the traversal more
efficient.</p>
<p>Threaded binary trees have several advantages over regular binary trees. They
use less memory, as the threads take up less space than full pointers. They also
allow for faster in-order traversal, as there is no need to follow null pointers
and backtrack. However, they are more difficult to modify than regular binary
trees, as the threads must be updated whenever the tree is modified.</p>
<p>Overall, threaded binary trees are a useful data structure for certain types of
tree traversal, but they may not be the best choice for all applications.</p>

    <title>doubly linked list</title>
    <link href="https://anzenkodo.github.io/notes/Programming/data-structure/linked-list/doubly-linked-list.html" />
    <updated>2023-01-11T08:38:07.702Z</updated>
    <id>/notes/Programming/data-structure/linked-list/doubly-linked-list.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A doubly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of
nodes, where each node stores a value and pointers to the previous and next
nodes in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last
node in the list is called the tail. The head node typically has a NULL prev
pointer, and the tail node typically has a NULL next pointer, to indicate the
beginning and end of the list, respectively.</p>
<p>Doubly linked lists are useful for storing and manipulating sequences of data,
as they allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position
in the list. They also allow for efficient access to both the next and previous
elements in the list, as each node stores pointers to both its neighbors.</p>
<h2>Difference between Doubly and Singly Linked List?</h2>
<h3>Number of pointers</h3>
<p>A singly linked list stores a single pointer per node, which points to the next
node in the list. In contrast, a doubly linked list stores two pointers per
node, which point to the next and previous nodes in the list.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>A singly linked list allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at
any position in the list, but does not allow for efficient access to elements at
arbitrary positions. In contrast, a doubly linked list allows for efficient
insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list, as well as
efficient access to both the next and previous elements in the list.</p>
<h3>Memory usage</h3>
<p>A doubly linked list uses more memory than a singly linked list, as it stores
two pointers per node instead of just one. This can make it less efficient in
situations where memory usage is a concern.</p>
<h2>Agorithm to create doubly linked list and display the list.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Declare a head pointer and make it as NULL. This will be used to keep track
of the first node in the list.</li>
<li>Declare a tail pointer and make it as NULL. This will be used to keep track
of the last node in the list.</li>
<li>Read in the values for the nodes in the list.</li>
<li>For each value, create a new node with the value and set its next and prev
pointers to NULL.</li>
<li>If the list is empty, set the head and tail pointers to the new node.</li>
<li>If the list is not empty, set the next pointer of the tail node to the new
node, and the prev pointer of the new node to the tail node. Then, update the
tail pointer to point to the new node.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 4-6 until all values have been read in.</li>
<li>Traverse the list from the head and print the values of the nodes. To do
this, set a pointer to the head of the list and follow the next pointers
until you reach the end of the list.</li>

    <title>singly linked list</title>
    <link href="https://anzenkodo.github.io/notes/Programming/data-structure/linked-list/singly-linked-list.html" />
    <updated>2023-01-11T08:38:07.702Z</updated>
    <id>/notes/Programming/data-structure/linked-list/singly-linked-list.html</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A singly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of
nodes, where each node stores a value and a pointer to the next node in the
list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node in the
list is called the tail. The tail node typically has a NULL next pointer to
indicate the end of the list.</p>
<p>Singly linked lists are useful for storing and manipulating sequences of data,
as they allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position
in the list. However, they do not allow for efficient access to elements at
arbitrary positions, as you have to traverse the list from the beginning to
access elements further down the list.</p>
<p>For example, to access the third element in a singly linked list with four
nodes, you would have to start at the head of the list and follow the next
pointers twice to reach the third node. This requires you to traverse the list
from the beginning, which can be inefficient if the list is large and you need
to access elements towards the end of the list.</p>
<p>In contrast, data structures like arrays or random-access lists allow for
efficient access to elements at arbitrary positions, as you can directly access
any element by its index. However, they may not be as efficient for inserting or
deleting elements at specific positions, as this may require shifting elements
around in the data structure.</p>
<p>Singly linked lists are efficient for inserting or deleting elements at specific
positions because they only require a single pointer per node, which makes it
easy to update the next pointers of the nodes around the insertion or deletion
point. Example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new node with the desired value.</li>
<li>Set the next pointer of the new node to point to the current fourth node in
the list.</li>
<li>Set the next pointer of the second node in the list to point to the new node.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<pre><code>  head                                      tail
+------+    +------+    +------+    +------+
| data |    | data |    | data |    | data |
+------+    +------+    +------+    +------+
| next |---&gt;| next |---&gt;| next |---&gt;| next |---&gt; NULL
+------+    +------+    +------+    +------+
</code></pre>
<h2>Algorithm to insert new nodes at the beginning of singly Linked list</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Declare a head pointer and make it as NULL:</strong> The head pointer is a pointer
that points to the first node in the list. By initializing it to NULL, you
create an empty list with no nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new node with the given data:</strong> To insert a new node at the
beginning of the list, you first need to create a new node with the desired
data. This can be done using a function that allocates memory for the new
node and sets its data field to the given value.</li>
<li><strong>Make the new node points to the head node:</strong> After creating the new node,
you need to update its next pointer to point to the current head node. This
will make the new node the first node in the list, with the head node as the
second node.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, make the new node as the head node:</strong> To complete the insertion,
you need to update the head pointer to point to the new node. This will make
the new node the first node in the list and the head of the list.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the last node points to
the first node, creating a circular chain. This structure has several advantages
over a traditional linear linked list:</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for easier traversal: In a circular linked list, you can traverse
the entire list by starting at any node and following the next pointers until
you reach the starting node again. In a linear linked list, you would have to
check whether you have reached the end of the list at each step.</li>
<li>It allows for efficient insertion and deletion at the beginning or end of the
list: In a circular linked list, the last node is always adjacent to the
first node, so you can easily insert or delete nodes at either end of the
list without having to traverse the entire list.</li>
<li>It allows for efficient implementation of queue data structures: A queue is a
data structure that allows for insertion at one end (the back of the queue)
and deletion at the other end (the front of the queue). In a circular linked
list, you can implement a queue by keeping a pointer to both the front and
back of the queue and using the next pointers to move between nodes. This
allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the use of a circular linked list can make certain operations more
efficient compared to a linear linked list, particularly when it comes to
inserting and deleting nodes at the beginning or end of the list, or when
implementing queue data structures.</p>]]></content>

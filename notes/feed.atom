<li>About Amateurs
<ul>
<li>Why being amateurs are better than Professionals?

<li>Amateurs are willing to try anything.</li>
<li>They can share share anything without worry looking good.</li>
<li>Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing
nothing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to stay amateurs?
<ul>
<li>For professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s
spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown.</li>
<li>I you feel like being to comfortable then try something new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media
<ul>
<li>
<p>Own Website &amp; Blog with own domain name is more important than Social Media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to start social media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of
what they’re not sharing.</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no
matter how bad they are at first.</li>
<li>Don’t worry, for now, about how you’ll make money or a career off it.</li>
<li>Forget about being an expert or a professional.</li>
<li>Share what you love.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to share in social media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort your content with only so meaningful bits thing left behind.</li>
<li>Make you content into small bits</li>
<li>Share you small bits in different pieces.</li>
<li>Share your influences and what’s inspiring you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to share about projects?</p>

<li>If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods
or share works in progress.</li>
<li>If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product.</li>
<li>Share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned.</li>

<li>When and where it was made?</li>
<li>Why you’re sharing it?</li>
<li>Why people should care about it?</li>
<li>Where people can see some more work like it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give proper credit to inspiration or creater of content you make.</li>
<li>If you don’t know who made then don’t share it.</li>
<li>You give credit because people are lazy they don’t search in google to
find the credated artist.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>What to put on social media?</p>

<li>So don’t post things online that you’re not ready for everyone in the
world to see.</li>
<li>You need feedback but don’t share absolutely everything.</li>
<li>Only put something online if helpful or entertaining.</li>
<li>If you don’t know to put something online or not then put it for only 24 H
and see the response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flow to Stock</p>
<ul>
<li>First put small bits of content (like: tweet, photos, short video).</li>

<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>John T. Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would
do a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, “Your
poem changed my life, man!” And John would say, “Oh, thanks. Want to buy a book?
It’s five dollars.” And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and
say, “Nah, that’s okay.” To which John would respond, “Geez, how much is your
life worth?”</p>

<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of
the International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family
were sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate
interest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced
major budget cuts and needed more public support. “Dad wanted a way to help
people connect with the real side of what an astronaut’s life is,” said
Hadfield’s son Evan. “Not just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day
activities.”</p>
<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>
<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him
set up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,
while performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered
questions from his followers, posted pictures he’d taken of Earth, recorded
music, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his
teeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions
of people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, “Wouldn’t
normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT’S IN
SPACE!”</p>

<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided
“every day now is an extra day,” dedicated himself to film, and went on to
direct Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he
was held up while working at a Long John Silver’s. “I realized I was going to
die,” he says. “And when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .
. . I thought, <em>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m
going to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.</em>”</p>
<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the
throat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy
and life was good. “You’d like to think that nearly getting killed would be a
permanently life-altering experience,” Kreider writes, but “the illumination
didn’t last.” Eventually, he was back to “the busy work of living.” The writer
George Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, “For three or
four days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in
it, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to
really have that</p>

<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to
treat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either
scribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward
computer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>
<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to
Facebook, and blogging at <a href="http://rogerebert.com/">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped
out posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about
everything he could think of—his boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak
’n Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his
inevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,
and he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with
the world. “On the web, my real voice finds expression,” he wrote.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Personal Values</h1>
<p>Author: Mark Manson Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 50 Progress:
✔️</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<h3>Good values are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Evidence-based</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>That “cause” is often what we refer to as our “purpose” and finding it is one
of the most important endeavors we can take to enhance our health and
well-being. But our purpose should be sought not merely through what feels
good. It must be considered and reasoned. We must accumulate evidence
supporting it.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Constructive</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is money for why what you value is often not as important as why you
value it. If you value martial arts because you enjoy hurting people, then
that’s a bad value. But if you value it because you are in the military and
want to learn to protect yourself and others—that’s.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.Controllable</p>
<ul>
<li>Money for the sake of money is bad value because you can’t always control it.
Creativity or industriousness or a strong work ethic are good values because
you CAN control them–and doing them well will ultimately generate money as a
side effect.</li>
<li>We need values we can control, otherwise our values control us.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g: honesty, building something new, vulnerability , standing up for oneself,
standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>
<h3>Bad values are:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Emotion-based</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Psychological research shows that most of us, most of the time, make decisions
and are inspired to action via our feelings , rather than based on knowledge
or information. Psychological research also shows us that our feelings are
generally self-centered, willing to give up long-term benefits for short-term
gains, and ae often warped and/or delusional.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Destructive</li>
<li>Uncontrollable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When you value things that are outside your control, you essentially give up
your life to that thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g: Dominating others through manipulation or violence, fucking more men/women,
feeling good all the time , always being the center of attention, not being
alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich,
sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.</p>
<h3>How to change values?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can’t argue someone out of their values . You can’t shame them into
valuing something different (shaming them actually often has the opposite
effect—they double down).</li>
<li>To let go of a value, it must be contradicted through experience. Sometimes
this contradiction happens by taking the value to its logical conclusion. E.g.
Too much partying ultimately makes life feel empty and meaningless.</li>
<li>When our values fail, we have two knee-jerk justifications:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The world sucks</li>
<li>We suck</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So instead of chasing money all the time, you could chase freedom. Instead of
trying to be liked by everyone, you could value developing intimacy with a
few. Instead of trying to win everything, you could focus on merely giving
your best effort.</li>
<li>If your primary value in life is how much money you have, then you will always
need more money. But if your primary value is personal freedom, then you will
need more money for a while, but there might be some situations where you need
less money.</li>
<li>Ultimately, abstract values are values you can control. You can always control
whether you’re being honest or not. You cannot control if people like you. You
can always control whether you’re giving your best effort. You can’t always
control if you win or not. You can always control if you’re doing something
you find meaningful , you can’t always control how much you’ll get paid.</li>
<li>Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings
or even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.</li>
<li>The whole world cannot always be bargained with, nor should we subject every
aspect of our life to a series of transactions. You don’t want to bargain with
your father for love, or your friends for companionship, or your boss for
respect.
<ul>
<li>If you have to convince someone to love you, then they don’t love you.</li>
<li>The most precious and important things in life cannot be bargained with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Honesty is inherently good and valuable, in and of itself.
<ul>
<li>An adult will love freely without expecting anything in return because an
adult understands that that is the only thing that can make love real.</li>
<li>An adult will give without expectation, without seeking anything in return,
because to do so defeats the purpose of a gift in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are always free to choose. And not only are you free to choose, but you
are obliged to choose who you are going to be, whether you realize it or not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fault</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s impossible to ever completely screw your kid up. But it’s impossible to
make them perfect too.</li>
<li>Let the child be who the child is going to be.</li>
<li>It’s not all their fault. To be honest, at some point, it doesn’t even matter
whose fault it is. Because it’s always your responsibility. So if it’s a big
hole, start climbing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Grow up?</h2>
<h3>FAIL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pleasure/pain values fail for the simple reason that pleasure and pain are bad
long-term predictors of health, growth , and happiness.
<ul>
<li>What about lying to a friend? Or waking up early for work? Or, like, not
doing heroin. Those are just a few of the millions of examples where
pursuing pleasure/pain values will lead you astray.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alcoholism isn’t bad because your body is a temple and self-harm is
intrinsically wrong—those are adult values.</p>
<p>No, alcoholism is bad because it’s a bad trade-off. It hurts people. People who
don’t deserve it. People you love and want to help. It fucks up other life
plans. It destroys families, finances, and fidelity. It’s essentially giving up
a mountain for a molehill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to suffer for the right
reasons than to feel pleasure for the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>Adulthood occurs when one realizes that it’s better to love and lose than to
never love at all.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Enlightenment Now</h1>
<p>Author: Steven Pinker Created time: August 20, 2021 11:29 AM Page No.: 576
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Education
<ul>
<li>More than 80 percent of the world was unschooled; by 1900.</li>
<li>83 percent of the world is literate.</li>
<li>Middle Eastern and North African countries, more than three-quarters of the
people over sixty-five are illiterate, whereas the rate for those in their
teens and twenties is in the single digits.</li>
<li>According to current projections, by the middle of this century, only five
countries will have more than a fifth of their population uneducated, and by
the end of the century the worldwide proportion will fall to zero.</li>
<li>Less-educated people reported having more leisure.</li>
<li>Early in the 19th century, 12 percent of the world could read and write;
today 83 percent can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Politics
<ul>
<li>Engagement with politics is like sports fandom in another way: people seek
and consume news to enhance the fan experience, not to make their opinions
more accurate.</li>
<li>Liberals are more hostile and aggressive.</li>
<li>Conservatives are indeed more prejudiced against African Americans, but
liberals turn out to be more prejudiced against religious Christians.</li>
<li>Conservatives are indeed more biased toward allowing Christian prayers in
schools, but liberals are more biased toward allowing Muslim prayers in
schools.</li>
<li>But just when we need this disinterested forum the most, academia has become
more politicized as well—not more polarized, but more left-wing. Colleges
have always been more liberal than the American population.</li>
<li>Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces
(such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and
manpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic
happens, and it fails to make the news.</li>
<li>Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared
with only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but
without data, you would never know it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement of world
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more
fortunate countries to 81.</li>
<li>Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.</li>
<li>Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most
liberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking
countries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist
countries of central Europe.</li>
<li>People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the
idea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over
time.</li>
<li>Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th
century, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car
accident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99
percent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall
to their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less
likely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent
less likely to be killed on the job.</li>
<li>“drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human
life. . . . Health research is displacing R&amp;D that could have gone toward
more mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life
virtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and
they constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that
this tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the
stagnation of progress.</li>
<li>Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have
values today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvement in Lifestyle
<ul>
<li>Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in
2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the
washing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the
Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children
than stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.</li>
<li>Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty
rate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10
percent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.</li>
<li>Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier
than their helicoptering parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human nature
<ul>
<li>Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those
with meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.</li>
<li>Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones
makes it more meaningful.</li>
<li>People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,
struggle, and worry.</li>
<li>Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are
opened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely
human cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past
and stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of
acquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability
to persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and
efficacy.</li>
<li>People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to
think it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and
helplessness.</li>
<li>Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor
plummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out
of desperation rather than greed.</li>
<li>People saw more infractions by the other team.</li>
<li>Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an
effective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biases
<ul>
<li>People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,
to discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.</li>
<li>People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with
the consequences of their opinions.</li>
<li>People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when
they are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are
after the truth rather than trying to win a debate.</li>
<li>To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as
much as is feasible.</li>
<li>When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like
it if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the
other—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective
merits.</li>
<li>People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their
beliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you
than to pay attention to those who agree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Media
<ul>
<li>Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,
feel more supported, and are more politically involved.</li>
<li>Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and
they empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their
successes.</li>
<li>They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely
to want a large number of friend.</li>
<li>Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the
1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,
have become any less social.</li>
<li>People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,
unions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal
gatherings and via digital media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tech
<ul>
<li>The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed
to weaponize it.</li>
<li>And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work
to defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.</li>
<li>That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into
preventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of
years of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of
biology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries
<ul>
<li>Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and
regulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western
Europe) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to
live, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human
flourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,
and happiness.</li>
<li>Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries
have gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get
happier still.</li>
<li>The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in
liberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market
freedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.</li>
<li>Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but
what about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in
boring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without
violence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the
former Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cyber Attack
<ul>
<li>The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking
confidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016
American election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a
botnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.</li>
<li>Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weapon
<ul>
<li>The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the
world’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make
lousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,
and citizens of the side that uses them.</li>
<li>The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works
against the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.</li>
<li>Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold
virus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can
shake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy
and kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body
to body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for
cholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish
flu).</li>
<li>If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States
can launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber
aircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a
first strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forecasters
<ul>
<li>The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or
right-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but
misguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event
was to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned
out to be.</li>
<li>These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they
could. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their
speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on
the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not
certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more
readily admitted it and changed their minds.47</li>
<li>They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to
experience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for
cognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative
complexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).</li>
<li>They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are
neither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their
abilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as
“hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”</li>
<li>They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and
confirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Religions
<ul>
<li>Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are
education, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other
social services.</li>
<li>Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no
religion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or
poverty on the scales.</li>
<li>It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than
stay-at-homes, but</li>
<li>An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is
as charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer
who prays alone is not particularly charitable.</li>
<li>13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced
atheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be
fanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of
atheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far
in the 21st.</li>
<li>An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as
“not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”
down from close to 100 percent a century before.</li>
<li>Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other
factors constant.</li>
<li>When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,
they stop believing in miracles.</li>
<li>Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.</li>
<li>The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,
the more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who care about you?
<ul>
<li>The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is
meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.</li>
<li>You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws
of the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.</li>
<li>Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan
your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.</li>
<li>And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense
of feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across
billions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is
cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a
responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in
which we all can flourish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Others
<ul>
<li>The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been
lowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.</li>
<li>Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.</li>
<li>Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the
things that happen in the world is that people solve the problems
confronting them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the
liberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed
it—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong
more often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased
crime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal
numerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our
civilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to
Christian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,
“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this
nation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the
face of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars
was spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge
that was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your
mother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet. Um .
. . Could you install it for us?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Spain was an economic laggard among Western countries, even though Spaniards
were highly schooled, because Spanish education was controlled by the Catholic
Church, and “the children of the masses received only oral instruction in the
Creed, the catechism, and a few simple manual skills. . . . Science,
mathematics, political economy, and secular history were considered too
controversial for anyone but trained theologians.”</p>

<p>Author: Adam Grant Created time: March 13, 2021 5:53 AM Page No.: 338 Progress:
✔️</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>The best bet is to blindly generate novel ideas and gather more feedback from
fellow creators to hone his vision about which ones might prove useful. As an
investor, you’ll be able to see more clearly, but you’ll still be making
one-eyed gambles.</li>
<li>Don’t change the system rather aimed to earn status by becoming part of the
system and then changing it from within.</li>
<li>Agreeable and Disagreeable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Agreeable- people were happiest in the moments when they doled out compliments
and praise, smiled and laughed with others, expressed affection, reassured
others, and compromised.</li>
<li>Disagreeable- people’s greatest joy when they were criticizing, confronting,
or challenging others.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The fall from low to lower hardly hurts. The fall from the middle to low is
devastating.</li>
<li>Research shows that the mistakes we regret are not errors of commission, But
errors of omission.</li>
<li>Pioneers and Settlers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The pioneers were first movers the initial company to develop or sell a
product.
<ul>
<li>47 percent of the failure rate.</li>
<li>10% of the market share.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The settlers were slower to launch, waiting until the pioneers had c treated a
market before entering.
<ul>
<li>8 percent of the failure rate.</li>
<li>22% of the market share.</li>
<li>Settlers are often branded as copycats, but this stereotype misses the mark.
Instead of conforming to the existing demand, they bide their time until
they’re ready to introduce something new. Slow to enter because they’re
working on revolutionary products, services, or technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of
every four fail because of premature scaling—<strong>making investments that the
market isn’t yet ready to support</strong>.</li>
<li>The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to
rush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.</li>
<li>Conceptual &amp; Experimental innovators</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.
<ul>
<li>Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.</li>
<li>Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.</li>
<li>Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk
copying, themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and
evolving as they go along.
<ul>
<li>Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.</li>
<li>45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.</li>
<li>The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: <strong>instead
of reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering
new one’s</strong>.</li>
<li>:eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate
expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas
from the past.</strong> Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your
imagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your
peripheral vision.</li>
<li>The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more
strongly you identify with an extreme group, <strong>the harder you seek to
differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values</strong>.</li>
<li>Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. <strong>When the overlap in
tactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less
likely</strong>. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have
less to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be
redundant.</li>
<li>You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing
something original that challenges the status quo.</li>
<li>Negative &amp; Ambivalent Relationship</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague
consistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.</li>
<li>Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions
about when that person can actually be trusted.
<ul>
<li>Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative
relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re
the ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet
again, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.</li>
<li>People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started
out negative and then become more positive.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince
them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing
theirs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our
agendas to familiar values that people already hold.</strong></li>
<li>As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals
occasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to
attempt to steal a base.</li>
<li>Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns
believed in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.</li>
<li>An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old
firstborn.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often
coincides with societal expectations.</li>
<li>Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a
cheater.”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person
in the mirror.</li>
<li>But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality
is tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of
Meena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of <strong>Martin Luther King,
Jr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela</strong>.</li>
<li>Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star,
and commitment.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills:
Founders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or
scientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.
<ul>
<li>Failure rates we’re were worse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future
potential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The
individuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular
area, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.
<ul>
<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and
challenging tasks.</li>
<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural
fit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the
company’s values and norms.
<ul>
<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees
and to the organization.</li>
<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in
the organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the
mission.</li>
<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms
was zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>
<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>
<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model
and more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>
<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower
than star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>
<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or
integrating a diverse workforce.</li>
<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too
insular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and
they’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.
As a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more
reliable financial results than their competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their
perspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of
dissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from
people who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>
<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times
higher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the
founder’s original model.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of
the firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on
potential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>
<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the
founder.</li>
<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with
commitment blueprints.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who
reinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers
throw culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates
can improve the culture.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles
against it than in support of it.</li>
<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>
<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the
principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>
<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on
different values or interpret the same values differently.</li>
<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and
<strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act
in the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear
of failing.</li>
<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be
crippled by fear.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and
convert it into motivation.</li>
<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering
every relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables
them to feel a sense of control.</li>
<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the
difficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>
<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature
positive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic
product decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too
optimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention
to potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to
take preventative and corrective actions.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more
terrifying than the negative.</li>
<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>
<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re
not alone.</li>
<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>
<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to
emphasize losses rather than gains.</li>
<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with
the present.</li>
<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation
or revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better
system. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>
<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the
first place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by
people, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to
consider how they can be improved.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>
<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is
incomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or
writing process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give
ideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,
and you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s
also tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they
evaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by
peers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>
<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>
<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from
Lisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to
spend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of
business</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.
Then, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert
them into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>
<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a
monthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones
are worth solving.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do
you think this made her feel?”.</li>
<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Story</h1>
<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit <a href="http://dosomething.org/">DoSomething.org</a>, CEO
Nancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,
because they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.
Employees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have
to explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because
the title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to
contribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just
thirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of
speaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for
delivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades
testing out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the
thousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different
melodies and refrains.</p>
<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a
series of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to
explain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.
Explaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to
explain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.
Considering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize
that some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>
<hr>
<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to
encourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David
Hofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>
<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a
significant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical
professionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent
more soap and gel</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their
early thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,
the vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,
psychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments
to changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a
major influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations
to drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been
influenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their
mentors.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse
workforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the
navy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he
didn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took
on; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and
dedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same
passions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and
cohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your
organization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever
encountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.
Headquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in
investments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its
philosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the
founder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a
word about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any
situation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful
work and build meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees
are hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating
that’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp
modeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the
principles, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and
evaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s
always a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,
to the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for
employees to stay for decades.</p>
<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,
but its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,
both of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.
They’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in
the history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the
combined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>
<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the
Steve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone
special. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a
meeting with an important potential client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50
minutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all
because there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the
outset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a
“must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who
attended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A
to F.</p>
<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be
fired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the
country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,
they are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance
by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon
they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to
start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,
pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars
and trucks at a glacial pace.</p>

<p>Author: Adam Grant Created time: March 13, 2021 6:21 AM Page No.: 384 Progress:
⭕</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>Giver Vs Taker</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses.
<ul>
<li>Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways
to knock them down a notch.</li>
<li>Takers tend to be <strong>self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person
singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me —versus first-person plural
pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21
percent of CEOs’ first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme
takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of
every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four
were about themselves alone and no one else.</li>
<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in
their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt
entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>
<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms
<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total
shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger
losses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung
for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and
larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.
Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put
their companies in jeopardy.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97">Giver and Taker</a> On the left
side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about
me. A big photo is self-glorifying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than
gunning for them.
<ul>
<li>Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success
of people around them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse
skills, and power.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to
knowledge, expertise, and influence.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of
dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a
favor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they
get what they want. <strong>This faker style of networking</strong> casts the entire
enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make
connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.</li>
<li>When <strong>people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational
information</strong>. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form
of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker
tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as
<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning
bridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Storys</h1>
<hr>
<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored
with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his
computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech
server. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the
music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band
skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lekking</strong> - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their
established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court
female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even
do acrobatics.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Quotes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don’t make enemies
out there, it’s easier to succeed. — Randy Komisar</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have one vice, and I can call it nothing else—it is not to be able to say
no! — Abraham Lincoln</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a
marathon. — Chip Conley</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A service provider. Entrepreneurs are not here to serve venture capitalists.
We are here to serve entrepreneurs. — David Hornik</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My default is to give, I’m not looking for quid pro quo; I’m looking to make a
difference and have an impact, and I focus on the people who can benefit from
my help the most. — Sherry and Please</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Above all, I want to demonstrate that success doesn’t have to come at someone
else’s expense. — David Hornik</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism
or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. — Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely
no good. — Samuel Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t
succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from
investments in meaningful activities and relationships. — Wayne Baker</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Social networks have always existed, It is only recently that the Internet has
provided a venue for their electronic explosion. . . . From mundane
communication to meeting the love of one’s life to inciting political
revolutions, network ties are the conduits by which information and resources
are spread. — Science</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s better to give before you receive. — Keith Ferrazzi</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you meet people you should be asking yourself, ‘How can I help the other
person? — Guy Kawasaki</p>

<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 9:01 PM Page No.: 146
Progress: ✔️</p>
<p>A philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate,
resourceful, and connected.</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make database of people &amp; and how often I should contact them.</li>
<li>Build some persona for people to look up to.</li>
<li>Never give to I am contacting someone.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>How to use friends database?
<ul>
<li>Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.</li>
<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>
<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>
<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have
their correct info.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Normal World &amp; Business World
<ul>
<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they
don’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a
total loser.</li>
<li>But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,
you’re a loser!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to be cool?
<ul>
<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal
boring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had
the courage.</li>
<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but
it’s considerate and part of your art.</li>
<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only
great at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.</li>
<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them
curious.</li>
<li>Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme
character. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About People
<ul>
<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.</li>
<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a
friend. That’s how things are done</li>
<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that
thing is popular.</li>
<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with
your existing contacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business
<ul>
<li>How beat competitor?
<ul>
<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>
<li>Don’t try to beat them at their game.</li>
<li>Play a completely different game.</li>
<li>Be radically opposite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters
<ul>
<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.
Make sure they stick together as a group.</li>
<li>Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not
yourself. Make it fun to join.</li>
<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are
having.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been
done.
<ul>
<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use
Amazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not
be able to imagine that niche without you.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your
attention</li>
<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that
it’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>
<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>
<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,
competition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,
being a good generous person, doing what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that
you’re giving them something valuable in return.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate
to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>
<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was
completely ignored.</p>
<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d
received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a
second inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>
<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the
chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it
in a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare
time.</p>
<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the
third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a
conference.</p>
<p>She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing
problem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to
get the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the
publisher.</p>
<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for
permission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they
contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”</p>
<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>
<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>
<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They
love it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,
“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on
music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and
tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”
Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing
their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,
and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious
and overwhelming.</p>

<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts.</li>
<li>They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities.</li>
<li>They learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.</li>
<li>The more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example.</li>
<li>Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Learn with Mix things</strong> not a Single thing.</li>
<li>The more likely an expert was to have his or her predictions featured on op-ed pages and television, <strong>the more likely they were always wrong.</strong></li>
<li>The best forecasters view their own ideas as <strong>hypotheses in need of testing.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, <strong>but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crew leadership not as decision making, but as sensemaking.
<ul>
<li>If I make a decision, it is a possession, I take pride in it, I tend to defend it and not listen to those who question it.</li>
<li>If I make sense, then this is more dynamic and I listen and I can change it.</li>

<h1>Storys</h1>
<p>Dark horses were on the hunt for match quality. “They never look around and say, ‘Oh, I’m going to fall behind, these people started earlier and have more than me at a younger age,’”</p>
<p>Ogas told me.</p>
<p>“They focused on, ‘Here’s who I am at the moment, here are my motivations, here’s what I’ve found I like to do, here’s what I’d like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which of these is the best match right now? And maybe a year from now I’ll switch because I’ll find something better.’”</p>

<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Start teaching someone something and that you business starts.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Clients of Your Business
<ul>
<li>The Problem with big clients like Google, Microsoft &amp; Apple.
<ul>
<li>You have to custom-tailor your product to please a very few specific people.</li>
<li>Those people might change their minds or leave the company.</li>
<li>Whom are you really working for? Are you self-employed or is this client your boss?</li>
<li>If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own you.</li>
<li>By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose wants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good thing about small clients.
<ul>
<li>You don’t need to change what you do to please one client; you need to please only the majority (or yourself).</li>
<li>If one client needs to leave, it’s OK; you can sincerely wish her well.</li>
<li>Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).</li>
<li>You hear hundreds of people’s opinions and stay in touch with what the majority of your clients want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes happy &amp; fulfilling.</li>
<li>When you are at something great you don’t feel something big going to happen.</li>
<li>You can’t prevent bad things from happening. Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.</li>
<li>Business improvement.
<ul>
<li>Customers satisfaction.
<ul>
<li>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.</li>
<li>Make every decision even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone according to what’s best for your customers.</li>
<li>If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important things to remember.
<ul>
<li>Don’t let other people play with your fear. Like Saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios. Those are just sales tactics.</li>
<li>Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come to you because you’ve shown how much you value them.</li>
<li>Don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.</li>
<li>Act like you don’t need the money. Because banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it. Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help. <strong>It’s a strange law of human behavior. It’s pretty universal.</strong></li>
<li>You don’t need something big to improve the business sometimes it’s little things that’s add up.</li>
<li>People remember you more for the smile that you put on there face then fancy business stuff.</li>
<li>Always prepare for 2x because anytime it can come.</li>

<li>Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles.</li>
<li>To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solve problems
<ul>
<li>Before trusting someone verify that they can do the job.</li>
<li>Why businesses keep problems around? (Like- Nord VPN)
→A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can keep solving it for a fee.</li>
<li>If the company has a problem with your decisions then explain your thought process and philosophy.</li>
<li>If you are an owner of the company you can be anything. And if don’t feel like doing something then give the role to someone who loves doing that role.</li>
<li>Don’t freedom but don’t give too much that they can overturn you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start now. No funding needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal improvement.
<ul>
<li>Don’t follow other people path without making your own path.</li>
<li>Don’t spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them you should want.</li>
<li>If present is worse than past, then move back and restart improving where things are good.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.</li>
<li>Doing work yourself is inefficient but it is what make it so joyful in the first place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derek Sivers philosophies of Business.
<ul>
<li>Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.</li>
<li>Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.</li>
<li>When you make a company, you make a utopia. It’s where you design your perfect world.</li>
<li>Never do anything just for the money.</li>
<li>Don’t pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.</li>
<li>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.</li>
<li>Your business plan is moot. You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.</li>
<li>Starting with no money is an advantage. You don’t need money to start helping people.</li>
<li>You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.</li>
<li>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</li>
<li>The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.</li>

<h1>Stories</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterward and the whole party marched down the 6th. I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your picture is on our wall as “Customer of the Year.” We’re all exhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to <a href="http://cdbaby.com/">CDBABY.COM</a>!! That one silly e-mail, sent out with every order, has been so loved</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That one silly e-mail, sent out with every order, has been so loved that if you search Google for “private CD Baby jet,” you’ll get almost twenty thousand results. Each one is somebody who got the email and loved it enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers. When you’re thinking of how to make your business</p>
<hr>
<p>We answered our phone within two rings, always 7am to 10pm, seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone had to do was say, “CD Baby!” Customers loved this! Someone actually picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to go with CD Baby—they could always talk to a weren’t completely swamped, they should take a minute and get to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it’s going. Yes, it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people became lifelong fans.</p>

<p>Author: Isaac Lyman Created time: March 12, 2021 8:36 PM Page No.: 184 Progress:
✔️</p>
<ol>
<li>Code is more about People then line.</li>
<li>Bad Tools can waste your time sometimes.</li>
<li>Don’t be religious about your tools it is just a tool not a human even a
living thing.</li>
<li>Nobody cars about your code</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can use whatever coding language or framework you want it is just a line
of code that can change by anybody. It is doesn’t matter that much.</li>
<li>It’s all about the product. The user cares about what you’ve built and how it
solves their problem, not so much about how you got there.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of
development.</li>
<li>If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally
belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you’re aware of
that possibility.</li>
<li>Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.</li>
<li>Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks
have conventions for how things are organized.</li>
<li>Consistent code style. It doesn’t matter what styles you choose.</li>
<li>start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an “About Me” web page, a
metric unit converter.</li>
<li>Burned out</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.</li>
<li>You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or
long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay</li>
<li>Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.</li>
<li>Keep your personal life separate from your work life.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Be the change you wish to see in our industry.</li>
<li>What I call myself</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower
than Junior Software Developer.</li>
<li>The programmer is a term that’s gone the way of the dinosaur.</li>
<li>The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If
your job involves building condominiums, you’re reading the wrong book.</li>
<li>Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the
highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally
I’ve heard it defined in contradictory ways.</li>
<li>JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good
name.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and
operations people.</li>
<li>The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny
operating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely
portable.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand something, Google it. If you can’t figure it out
easily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.</li>
<li>If someone has told you otherwise, you’re in the wrong company. Automate as
much as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far
more time-consuming.</li>
<li>Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need
to keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce
these expenses dramatically.</li>
<li>Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements
change or a solution already exists.</li>
<li>Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.</li>
<li>Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the “best way” to do
something.</li>
<li>The three virtues.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall
energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people
will find useful and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so
many questions about it.</li>
<li>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you
write programs that don’t just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate
them. Or at least pretend to.</li>
<li>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other
people won’t want to say bad things about.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<ol>
<li>When you’re first reading about something new in code.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why is this important or useful?</li>
<li>How does it fit with other topics or technologies?</li>
<li>What’s the problem that it’s trying to solve?</li>
</ul>]]></content>

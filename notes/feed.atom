<p>Description</p>
<h1>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Facts
<ul>
<li>90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words.</li>
<li>We all have twice as many female ancestors as male (imagine that all the women who have ever lived have averaged one child. Now imagine that half the men who have ever lived have fathered two children, if they had any, while the other half fathered none).</li>
<li>Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male descendants, 34 generations later.</li>
<li>Anger is one of the most common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns of crying children has confirmed this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should not overlook the guidelines of your culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</li>
<li>About ourselves
<ul>
<li>Order &amp; Chaos
<ul>
<li>Order is not enough. You can’t just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned.</li>
<li>Chaos can be too much. You can’t long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know.</li>
<li>If it is not useful it will be forgotten.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rules
<ul>
<li>We are rule generators. Humans can't live without rules.</li>
<li>Civilization only arises when some restraining rules and morality are in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hierarchy of value
<ul>
<li>A hierarchy of value, where some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act.</li>
<li>Dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emotions
<ul>
<li>Self-protective anger necessary to defend themselves.</li>
<li>Anger when skillfully integrated, the ability to respond with aggression and violence decreases rather than increases the probability that actual aggression will become necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Women
<ul>
<li>Women have been making men self-conscious since the beginning of time.</li>
<li>They do this primarily by rejecting them—but they also do it by shaming them, if men do not take responsibility.</li>
<li>Since women bear the primary burden of reproduction, it’s no wonder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideologies
<ul>
<li>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it.</li>
<li>Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</li>
<li>Ideologues are always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meaning
<ul>
<li>We are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering.</li>
<li>Meaning itself requires the difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the apparently impeccable logic of its message?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why we are not equal?
<ul>
<li>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be.</li>
<li>A very small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners don’t take all, but they take most.</li>
<li>The bottom is not a good place to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a devastating tale.</li>
<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why you compare yourself?
<ul>
<li>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed.</li>
<li>We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards.</li>
<li>In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because standards are necessary.</li>
<li>Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do.</li>
<li>As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who are you?
<ul>
<li>You think you know, but maybe you don’t.</li>
<li>You are, for example, neither your own master, nor your own slave.</li>
<li>You cannot easily tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and compel theirs).</li>
<li>You are interested in some things and not in others.</li>
<li>You can shape that interest, but there are limits.</li>
<li>Some activities will always engage you, and others simply will not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No one is more familiar than you with all the ways your mind and body are flawed.</li>
<li>If two people are fighting the third person have massive advantage.</li>
<li>We feel hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage.</li>
<li>The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What not to do?
<ul>
<li>Low self-worth people
<ul>
<li>when people have a low opinion of their own worth</li>
<li>When they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past.</li>
<li>Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it.</li>
<li>They don’t want the trouble of better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How internal critic puts you down?
<ul>
<li>First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of comparison (fame, maybe, or power).</li>
<li>Then it acts as if that domain is the only one that is relevant.</li>
<li>Then it contrasts you unfavourably with someone truly stellar, within that domain.</li>
<li>It can take that final step even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequence of remaining silent.
<ul>
<li>Because the consequence of remaining silent is worse.</li>
<li>Of course, it’s easier in the moment to stay silent and avoid conflict.</li>
<li>But in the long term, that’s deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny feeds on lies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What people do that they don't think they do?
<ul>
<li>I soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more detached, that paid attention and judged.</li>
<li>I soon came to realize that almost everything I said was untrue.</li>
<li>I had motives for saying these things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and get what I wanted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manipulate the World
<ul>
<li>It’s the specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths.</li>
<li>It’s the speech people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.</li>
<li>It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas.</li>
<li>It’s what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify themselves to please and flatter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to stop doing?
<ul>
<li>Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong . Start stopping today.</li>
<li>Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is.</li>
<li>You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why.</li>
<li>Simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop.</li>
<li>Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner.</li>
<li>Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Children
<ul>
<li>Children who cry more easily, for example, are more frequently bullied.</li>
<li>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About lies
<ul>
<li>For the big lie, you first need the little lie.</li>
<li>One of the greatest dangers: apparently everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want.</li>
<li>If you look close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the big lie starts. It</li>
<li>Broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.</li>
<li>During such a conversation, which often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to
<ul>
<li>Denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary position.</li>
<li>Use selective evidence while doing so and, finally.</li>
<li>Impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same ideological space) with the validity of his assertions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem with Man &amp; Women
<ul>
<li>Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion.</li>
<li>Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.</li>
<li>Too-early problem-solving may also merely indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the person seeking help did not want to improve. It was impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to improve was, instead, the precondition for progress.</li>
<li>The poor and stressed always die first, and in greater numbers. They are also much more susceptible to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. When the aristocracy catches a cold, as it is said, the working class dies of pneumonia.</li>
<li>Sometime people misery is your attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of there own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive and to live.</li>
<li>Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself? You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe, and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your microwave.</li>
<li>Person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.</li>
<li>You should never give up the better that resides within for the security you already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse, an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to change or improve the world and yourself?
<ul>
<li>About Truth
<ul>
<li>If you ever wonder how perfectly ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying it.</li>
<li>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you weaken your character.</li>
<li>Insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.</li>
<li>You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world.</li>
<li>You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient.</li>
<li>Do not lie especially to yourself.</li>
<li>You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself.</li>
<li>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</li>
<li>A man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate.</li>
<li>Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Self
<ul>
<li>Why to take care of yourself?
<ul>
<li>You are important to other people, as much as to yourself.</li>
<li>You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world.</li>
<li>You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself.</li>
<li>You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued.</li>
<li>The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to improve yourself.
<ul>
<li>Making your life better means adopting a lot of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Quit drooping and hunching around.</li>
<li>Speak your mind.</li>
<li>Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others.</li>
<li>Walk tall and gaze forthrightly.</li>
<li>Dare to be dangerous.</li>
<li>Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Improvement Steps
<ul>
<li>Start with yourself.</li>
<li>Take care with yourself.</li>
<li>Define who you are.</li>
<li>Refine your personality.</li>
<li>Choose your destination and articulate your Being.</li>
<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to know yourself?
<ul>
<li>You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.</li>
<li>You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.</li>
<li>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to do to not be in a resentful, vengeful and cruel?
<ul>
<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>
<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>
<li>You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>
<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why life is a game?
<ul>
<li>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or fail.</li>
<li>There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and sustain and even improve themselves across time.</li>
<li>Lawyer is a good game. So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher.</li>
<li>The world allows for many ways of Being.</li>
<li><strong>If you don’t succeed at one, you can try another.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to win?
<ul>
<li>Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</li>
<li>To realize that the specifics of the many games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that comparison to others is simply inappropriate.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s some real utility in gratitude.</li>
<li>It’s also good protection against the dangers of victimhood and resentment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Posture &amp; Bad Posture
<ul>
<li>If you slump, shoulders forward and rounded, chest tucked in, head down, looking small, defeated and ineffectual (protected, in theory, against attack from behind)—then you will feel small, defeated and ineffectual.</li>
<li>If you start to straighten up, then people will look at and treat you differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To improve your life aim small.
<ul>
<li>Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.</li>
<li>You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and ability to shirk responsibility.</li>
<li>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</li>
<li>Then you do what you have decided to do, even if you do it badly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world?
<ul>
<li>You ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns.</li>
<li>You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals.</li>
<li>You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path.</li>
<li>You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind).</li>
<li>And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.</li>
<li>You must shepherd your limited resources carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What should you do, when you don’t know what to do?
<ul>
<li>Tell the truth.</li>
<li>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two different choices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Listening to other people
<ul>
<li>You can be pretty smart if you can just shut up.</li>
<li>Two people tell each other the truth—and both listen.</li>
<li>I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly.</li>
<li>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things.</li>
<li>Very few of your conversations will be boring.</li>
<li>When a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time has the floor, and everyone else is listening.</li>
<li>The person speaking is granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy or even tragic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know .</li>
<li>Don't blame other for your problem you have to first solve your own problems first then go and solve the world problems.</li>
<li>Encourage people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care, as well as for the genuine concern and thoughtfulness they manifest towards others.</li>
<li>If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would have to respect ourselves.</li>
<li>Small wins can add up to big and small loses will add up to bigger loser.</li>
<li>No simple carbohydrates, no sugars, in the morning as they are digested too rapidly, and produce a blood-sugar spike and rapid dip.</li>
<li>If one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities.</li>
<li>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with your partner or, failing that, a friend.</li>
<li>If you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your reasons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship
<ul>
<li>Why we save people?
<ul>
<li>You are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous, well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing.</li>
<li>But it’s also possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will.</li>
<li>Or maybe you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck and birthplace.</li>
<li>Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why not help some people?
<ul>
<li>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.</li>
<li>You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation.</li>
<li>If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why people stay in unhealthy relationship?
<ul>
<li>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know it.</li>
<li>I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good person.” Not so.</li>
<li>It might be just a person trying to look good pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of actually being good and addressing something real.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bad Friends
<ul>
<li>If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself?</li>
<li>They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine.</li>
<li>They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.</li>
<li>They will override your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own.</li>
<li>Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.</li>
<li>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good Friends
<ul>
<li>Friends make to informed of your shortcomings.</li>
<li>You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly.</li>
<li>Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.</li>
<li>You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you.</li>
<li>It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</li>
<li>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.</li>
<li>They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not.</li>
<li>This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</li>
<li>It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A child who can’t share—who can’t trade—can’t have any friends, because having friends is a form of trade. <strong>You need to trust your friends before they trust you. You need to give love before you re</strong>ce<strong>ive it.</strong></li>
<li>When someone does something you are trying to get them to do, reward them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>About Culture
<ul>
<li>You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general, public opinion.</li>
<li>You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.</li>
<li>The crowd is by no means always right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider what you said.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Thinking</strong> - Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world and with the people you disagree with.</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> - Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is exploration, articulation and strategizing.</p>
<p><strong>Advice</strong> - Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have your stupid problems.</p>
<p><strong>Ideologies</strong> - are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to “make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own chaos within.</p>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>There is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence, recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,</p>
<hr>
<p>Therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some events, and downplay the importance of others.</p>

<p>A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy trail his mother and father slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn’t at the end of his tether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might object that “perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s contempt.</p>
<hr>
<p>Someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point. 64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. 65 Down is a lot easier than up.</p>

Progress: ⭕</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>Giver Vs Taker</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses.
<ul>
<li>Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways to knock them down a notch.</li>
<li>Takers tend to be <strong>self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me —versus first-person plural pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21 percent of CEOs’ first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four were about themselves alone and no one else.</li>
<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>
<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms <strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger losses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy. Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put their companies in jeopardy.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97">Giver and Taker</a> On the left side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about me. A big photo is self-glorifying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than gunning for them.
<ul>
<li>Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse skills, and power.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to knowledge, expertise, and influence.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a favor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they get what they want. <strong>This faker style of networking</strong> casts the entire enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.</li>
<li>When <strong>people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational information</strong>. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as <strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning bridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Storys</h1>
<hr>
<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech server. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>
<h1>Meaning</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lekking</strong> - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even do acrobatics.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Quotes</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don’t make enemies out there, it’s easier to succeed. — Randy Komisar</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have one vice, and I can call it nothing else—it is not to be able to say no! — Abraham Lincoln</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a marathon. — Chip Conley</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A service provider. Entrepreneurs are not here to serve venture capitalists. We are here to serve entrepreneurs. — David Hornik</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My default is to give, I’m not looking for quid pro quo; I’m looking to make a difference and have an impact, and I focus on the people who can benefit from my help the most. — Sherry and Please</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Above all, I want to demonstrate that success doesn’t have to come at someone else’s expense. — David Hornik</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. — Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good. — Samuel Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from investments in meaningful activities and relationships. — Wayne Baker</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Social networks have always existed, It is only recently that the Internet has provided a venue for their electronic explosion. . . . From mundane communication to meeting the love of one’s life to inciting political revolutions, network ties are the conduits by which information and resources are spread. — Science</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Originals</h1>
<p>Author: Adam Grant
Created time: March 13, 2021 5:53 AM
Page No.: 338
Progress: ✔️</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<ol>
<li>The best bet is to blindly generate novel ideas and gather more feedback from fellow creators to hone his vision about which ones might prove useful. As an investor, you’ll be able to see more clearly, but you’ll still be making one-eyed gambles.</li>
<li>Don’t change the system rather aimed to earn status by becoming part of the system and then changing it from within.</li>
<li>Agreeable and Disagreeable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Agreeable- people were happiest in the moments when they doled out compliments and praise, smiled and laughed with others, expressed affection, reassured others, and compromised.</li>
<li>Disagreeable- people’s greatest joy when they were criticizing, confronting, or challenging others.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The fall from low to lower hardly hurts. The fall from the middle to low is devastating.</li>
<li>Research shows that the mistakes we regret are not errors of commission, But errors of omission.</li>
<li>Pioneers and Settlers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The pioneers were first movers the initial company to develop or sell a product.
<ul>
<li>47 percent of the failure rate.</li>
<li>10% of the market share.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The settlers were slower to launch, waiting until the pioneers had c treated a market before entering.
<ul>
<li>8 percent of the failure rate.</li>
<li>22% of the market share.</li>
<li>Settlers are often branded as copycats, but this stereotype misses the mark. Instead of conforming to the existing demand, they bide their time until they’re ready to introduce something new. Slow to enter because they’re working on revolutionary products, services, or technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of every four fail because of premature scaling—<strong>making investments that the market isn’t yet ready to support</strong>.</li>
<li>The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to rush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.</li>
<li>Conceptual &amp; Experimental innovators</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.
<ul>
<li>Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.</li>
<li>Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.</li>
<li>Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk copying, themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and evolving as they go along.
<ul>
<li>Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.</li>
<li>45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.</li>
<li>The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: <strong>instead of reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering new one’s</strong>.</li>
<li>:eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas from the past.</strong> Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your imagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your peripheral vision.</li>
<li>The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more strongly you identify with an extreme group, <strong>the harder you seek to differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values</strong>.</li>
<li>Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. <strong>When the overlap in tactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less likely</strong>. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have less to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be redundant.</li>
<li>You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing something original that challenges the status quo.</li>
<li>Negative &amp; Ambivalent Relationship</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague consistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.</li>
<li>Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions about when that person can actually be trusted.
<ul>
<li>Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re the ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet again, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.</li>
<li>People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started out negative and then become more positive.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing theirs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our agendas to familiar values that people already hold.</strong></li>
<li>As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals occasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to attempt to steal a base.</li>
<li>Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns believed in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.</li>
<li>An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old firstborn.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often coincides with societal expectations.</li>
<li>Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a cheater.”</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person in the mirror.</li>
<li>But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality is tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of Meena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of <strong>Martin Luther King, Jr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela</strong>.</li>
<li>Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star, and commitment.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills: Founders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or scientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.
<ul>
<li>Failure rates we’re were worse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future potential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The individuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular area, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.
<ul>
<li>Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and challenging tasks.</li>
<li>Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. <strong>Cultural fit was a must.</strong> The top priority was to employ people who matched the company’s values and norms.
<ul>
<li>Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees and to the organization.</li>
<li>They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in the organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the mission.</li>
<li>When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms was zero—not a single one of them went out of business.</li>
<li>A better chance of making it to the stock market.</li>
<li>Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model and more than quadruple those of the professional model.</li>
<li>Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower than star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.</li>
<li>Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or integrating a diverse workforce.</li>
<li>Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too insular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and they’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently. As a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more reliable financial results than their competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The more <strong>CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their perspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort</strong> of dissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from people who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.</li>
<li>Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times higher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the founder’s original model.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of the firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on potential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.</li>
<li>Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the founder.</li>
<li>The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with commitment blueprints.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who reinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers throw culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates can improve the culture.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles against it than in support of it.</li>
<li>You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.</li>
<li>The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.</li>
<li>The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on different values or interpret the same values differently.</li>
<li>“Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and <strong>rebellious</strong>. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act in the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear of failing.</li>
<li>When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be crippled by fear.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and convert it into motivation.</li>
<li>Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering every relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables them to feel a sense of control.</li>
<li>Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the difficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.</li>
<li>Research shows that when <strong>American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature positive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic product decline during their terms in office</strong>. When presidents are too optimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention to potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to take preventative and corrective actions.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more terrifying than the negative.</li>
<li>When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.</li>
<li>If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re not alone.</li>
<li>Use humor as a weapon against fear.</li>
<li>We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to emphasize losses rather than gains.</li>
<li>If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with the present.</li>
<li>Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation or revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better system. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.</li>
<li><strong>Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the first place.</strong> When you remember that rules and systems were created by people, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to consider how they can be improved.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a new domain.</li>
<li>When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is incomplete. By taking a <strong>break in the middle of your brainstorming or writing process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give ideas time to incubate</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic, and you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s also tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they evaluate ideas. <strong>To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by peers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.</strong></li>
<li>Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the <strong>status quo will persist</strong>.</li>
<li>You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from Lisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to spend an hour brainstorming about <strong>how to put the organization out of business</strong>—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology. Then, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert them into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.</li>
<li>Ask for problems, not solutions.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a monthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones are worth solving.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do you think this made her feel?”.</li>
<li>Emphasize values over rules.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Story</h1>
<p>Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit DoSomething.org, CEO Nancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate, because they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it. Employees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have to explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because the title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to contribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just thirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of speaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for delivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades testing out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the thousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different melodies and refrains.</p>
<p>Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a series of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to explain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns. Explaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to explain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate. Considering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize that some of their extreme views were impractical.</p>
<hr>
<p>Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to encourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David Hofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:</p>
<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>sign on the left had no effect whatsoever</strong>. The sign on the right made a significant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical professionals to wash their hands <strong>10 percent more often and use 45 percent more soap and gel</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their early thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives, the vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later, psychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments to changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a major influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations to drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been influenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their mentors.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse workforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the navy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he didn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took on; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and dedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same passions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and cohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your organization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever encountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates. Headquartered in a Connecticut town, <strong>Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in investments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its philosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the founder.</strong> Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a word about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any situation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful work and build meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees are hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating that’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp modeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the principles, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and evaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s always a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community, to the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for employees to stay for decades.</p>
<p>Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry, but its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds, both of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades. They’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in the history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the combined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.</p>
<p>Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the Steve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone special. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a meeting with an important potential client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50 minutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all because there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the outset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a “must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who attended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A to F.</p>
<p>At Bridgewater, <strong>they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be fired for failing to challenge the status quo</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike, they are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon, pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars and trucks at a glacial pace.</p>

<h1>Meaning</h1>
<h1>Stories</h1>
<p>Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat with only 236 different words, so his editor bet him he couldn’t write a book with only 50 different words. Dr. Seuss came back and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s books of all time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter until my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed. But instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try to channel it into my writing and my drawing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but then I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade hardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.</p>
<p>About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel whole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my writing, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell that new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.</p>
<hr>
<p>“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his own.</p>

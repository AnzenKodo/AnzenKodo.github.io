<h1><a name="stories" class="heading-anchor" href="#stories" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Stories</h1>
<p>The writer David Sedaris is a born tidier. He tells childhood stories about
vacuuming and cleaning up after his siblings. When he sold his first book, he
was cleaning houses in Manhattan. Now he’s a rich bestselling author and lives
in a village west of London. Do you know how he spends most of his day? Picking
up trash on the side of the road.</p>

<p>That’s right: One of our most popular living authors estimates that he a garbage
truck after him: “Pig Pen Sedaris.” He’s best known to his neighbors as a litter
picker. When the West Sussex County Times wrote about him, they didn’t even
mention he was a writer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it
makes me happy just to do it . . . I think trying to be creative, keeping
busy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Willie Nelson</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“None of us know what will happen. Don’t spend time worrying about it. Make
the most beautiful thing you can. Try to do that every day. That’s it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Laurie Anderson</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Annie Dillard</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Relying on craft and routine is a lot less sexy than being an artistic
genius. But it is an excellent strategy for not going insane.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Christoph Niemann</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Your list is your past and your future. Carry at all times. Prioritize:
today, this week, and eventually. You will someday die with items still on
your list, but for now, while you live, your list helps prioritize what can be
done in your limited time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Tom Sachs</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The greatest need of our time is to clean out the enormous mass of mental and
emotional rubbish that clutters our minds and makes of all political and
social life a mass illness. Without this housecleaning, we cannot begin to
see. Unless we see, we cannot think.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Thomas Merton</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common
sense.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Gertrude Stein</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Keep your eye on your inner world and keep away from ads and idiots and movie
stars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Dorothea Tanning</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I paint with my back to the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Agnes Martin</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You have to have done something before you can be said to have done
something. The title of artist or architect or musician needs to somehow be
earned.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Dave Hickey</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are only responsible for your work so DO IT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Sol LeWitt to Eva Hesse</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“No artist can work simply for results; he must also like the work of getting
them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Robert Farrar Capon</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t make stuff because you want to make money—it will never make you enough
money. And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous—because you will
never feel famous enough. Make gifts for people—and work hard on making those
gifts in the hope that those people will notice and like the gifts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—John Green</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What I’m really concerned about is reaching one person.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Jorge Luis Borges</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s as true today as it ever was: He who seeks beauty will find it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Bill Cunningham</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Drawing is the discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world. I have
learned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen, and that when I
start drawing an ordinary thing, I realize how extraordinary it is, sheer
miracle.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Frederick Franck</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For anyone trying to discern what to do with their life: PAY ATTENTION TO
WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO. That’s pretty much all the info you need.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Amy Krouse Rosenthal</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Tell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—José Ortega y Gassett</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am for an art that helps old ladies across the street.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Claes Oldenburg</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed
ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.
One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be
determined to make them otherwise.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The artist’s natural state is one of not-knowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Donald Barthelme</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths
and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the
books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And
that means the old books . . . To be sure, the books of the future would be
just as good a corrective as the books of the past, but unfortunately we
cannot get at them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—C. S. Lewis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Things that belong together have been taken apart. And you can’t put it all
back together again. What you can do is the only thing that you can do. You
take two things that ought to be together and you put them together.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Wendell Berry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Go out and walk. That is the glory of life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>—Maira Kalman</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Imitate the trees. Learn to lose in order to recover, and remember that
nothing stays the same for long.”</p>
</blockquote>

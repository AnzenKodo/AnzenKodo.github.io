<ul>
<li>Just because something makes us feel bad doesn‚Äôt mean we are bad.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="points" class="heading-anchor" href="#points" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Demons and Shame?

<ul>
<li>Find it. Address it. And most importantly: accept it. Find that deep, dark
ugly part of yourself. Confront it, head-on, allowing yourself to feel all
the awful, icky emotions that come with it. Then accept that this is a part
of you and it‚Äôs never going away. And that‚Äôs fine. You can work with this,
rather than against it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self Discipline is easy with people than without them.</li>
<li>You pursue it rather than run from it. And with every pursuit, you get
stronger and healthier and happier.</li>
<li>Goal vs Habits

<ul>
<li>Goals are a one-time bargain. They are the spending mindset. ‚ÄúI will spend X
amount of energy to receive Y reward.‚Äù</li>
<li>Habits are an investing mindset. Habits require one to invest one‚Äôs efforts
for a little while and then take the rewards of that effort and re-invest
them in a greater effort to form even better habits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is okay to miss a day inhabit just remember it is part of the purposes.</li>
<li>People don‚Äôt develop and acquire habits at the same rate; everyone is
different.</li>
<li>Some habits are better than other habits because some habits once acquired,
make other positive habits much easier to acquire as well.

<ul>
<li>eg: quitting smoking is hard. But some data suggests that taking up some
form of exercises such as jogging or biking can make it easier for someone
to quit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You wouldn‚Äôt keep watching a TV show you don‚Äôt like. You wouldn‚Äôt eat an
entire plate of food you don‚Äôt like. So why the hell are you trying to read a
book you don‚Äôt like?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Waight Loss

<ul>
<li>I know someone who lost a lot of weight (almost 80 lbs) over a 2-year
period. He was running marathons by the time he was in shape, but you know
how he started out? Four minutes a day on the exercise bike. That‚Äôs all he
could do at first, but he did it every single day and increased his workout
as he lost more weight and gained more confidence.</li>
<li>Once he knew he could do a few minutes on the bike, he figured he could do a
few more, then he figured he could go for a run, then he believed he could
run competitively, then he set a goal to run a marathon and did it.</li>
<li>He didn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúOK, I‚Äôm ridiculously overweight so I should run a marathon.‚Äù
He instead started where he was, which was in his basement on an exercise
bike for four minutes a day. This kept him engaged and he didn‚Äôt feel too
overwhelmed while he was working to create a healthier lifestyle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Making Friends

<ul>
<li>Now, I don‚Äôt mean just bullshitty Facebook chatter. I mean genuine, ‚ÄúHey
man, what‚Äôs been going on with you lately? How have things been?‚Äù followed
by a couple, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs cool, tell me about that,‚Äù and finally finished off
with a, ‚ÄúWe should get together soon, what are you doing next week?‚Äù for
good measure.</li>
<li>It would take maybe 15-20 minutes at most. And it was surprising how easy it
was to reconnect with many people. Most of the time it was touching base
with some friends who I had kind of lost touch with.</li>
<li>Other times it was reaching out and taking a chance with getting to know
someone whom I barely knew. Other times it was going out and meeting
somebody new, maybe at a party or a conference or being introduced</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

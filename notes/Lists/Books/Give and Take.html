<ol>
<li>Giver Vs Taker</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses.

<ul>
<li>Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways
to knock them down a notch.</li>
<li>Takers tend to be <strong>self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person
singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me —versus first-person plural
pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21
percent of CEOs’ first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme
takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of
every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four
were about themselves alone and no one else.</li>
<li>The <strong>taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives</strong> in
their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt
entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.</li>
<li>In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms
<strong>had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total
shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger
losses.</strong> The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung
for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and
larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.
Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put
their companies in jeopardy.</li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97">Giver and Taker</a> On the left
side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about
me. A big photo is self-glorifying.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than
gunning for them.

<ul>
<li>Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success
of people around them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse
skills, and power.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to
knowledge, expertise, and influence.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of
dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a
favor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they
get what they want. <strong>This faker style of networking</strong> casts the entire
enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make
connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.</li>
<li>When <strong>people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational
information</strong>. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form
of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker
tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as
<strong>their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning
bridges with potential new ties</strong>.</li>

<p>Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored
with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his
computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech
server. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the
music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band
skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.</p>

<ul>
<li>When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their
established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court
female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even
do acrobatics.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don’t make enemies
out there, it’s easier to succeed. — Randy Komisar</p>

<p>If I have one vice, and I can call it nothing else—it is not to be able to say
no! — Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a
marathon. — Chip Conley</p>

<p>A service provider. Entrepreneurs are not here to serve venture capitalists.
We are here to serve entrepreneurs. — David Hornik</p>

<p>My default is to give, I’m not looking for quid pro quo; I’m looking to make a
difference and have an impact, and I focus on the people who can benefit from
my help the most. — Sherry and Please</p>

<p>Above all, I want to demonstrate that success doesn’t have to come at someone
else’s expense. — David Hornik</p>

<p>Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism
or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. — Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely
no good. — Samuel Johnson</p>

<p>If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t
succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks; the benefits ensue from
investments in meaningful activities and relationships. — Wayne Baker</p>

<p>Social networks have always existed, It is only recently that the Internet has
provided a venue for their electronic explosion. . . . From mundane
communication to meeting the love of one’s life to inciting political
revolutions, network ties are the conduits by which information and resources
are spread. — Science</p>

<p>It’s better to give before you receive. — Keith Ferrazzi</p>

<p>When you meet people you should be asking yourself, ‘How can I help the other
person? — Guy Kawasaki</p>

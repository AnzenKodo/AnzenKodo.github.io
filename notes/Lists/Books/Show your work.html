<p>John T. Unger tells this terrific story from his days as a street poet. He would
do a poetry reading and afterward some guy would come up to him and say, ‚ÄúYour
poem changed my life, man!‚Äù And John would say, ‚ÄúOh, thanks. Want to buy a book?
It‚Äôs five dollars.‚Äù And the guy would take the book, hand it back to John, and
say, ‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù To which John would respond, ‚ÄúGeez, how much is your
life worth?‚Äù</p>

<p>In 2013, the Internet fell in love with astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of
the International Space Station. Three years earlier, Hadfield and his family
were sitting around the dinner table, trying to figure out ways to generate
interest for the Canadian Space Agency, which, like many space programs, faced
major budget cuts and needed more public support. ‚ÄúDad wanted a way to help
people connect with the real side of what an astronaut‚Äôs life is,‚Äù said
Hadfield‚Äôs son Evan. ‚ÄúNot just the glamour and science, but also the day-to-day
activities.‚Äù</p>

<p>Commander Hadfield wanted to show his work.</p>

<p>Things fell into place when his sons explained social media to him and got him
set up on Twitter and other social networks. During his next five-month mission,
while performing all his regular astronautical duties, he tweeted, answered
questions from his followers, posted pictures he‚Äôd taken of Earth, recorded
music, and filmed YouTube videos of himself clipping his nails, brushing his
teeth, sleeping, and even performing maintenance on the space station. Millions
of people ate it all up, including my agent, Ted, who tweeted, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt
normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT‚ÄôS IN
SPACE!‚Äù</p>

<hr>

<p>When George Lucas was a teenager, he almost died in a car accident. He decided
‚Äúevery day now is an extra day,‚Äù dedicated himself to film, and went on to
direct Star Wars . Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips, was 16 when he
was held up while working at a Long John Silver‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI realized I was going to
die,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd when that gets into your mind . . . it utterly changed me .
. . I thought, _I‚Äôm not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I‚Äôm
going to make them happen, and if people think I‚Äôm an idiot I don‚Äôt care._‚Äù</p>

<p>Tim Kreider, in his book We Learn Nothing , says that getting stabbed in the
throat was the best thing to ever happen to him. For a whole year, he was happy
and life was good. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd like to think that nearly getting killed would be a
permanently life-altering experience,‚Äù Kreider writes, but ‚Äúthe illumination
didn‚Äôt last.‚Äù Eventually, he was back to ‚Äúthe busy work of living.‚Äù The writer
George Saunders, speaking of his own near-death experience, said, ‚ÄúFor three or
four days after that, it was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in
it, you know? And I thought, if you could walk around like that all the time, to
really have that</p>

<hr>

<p>When the late film critic Roger Ebert went through several intense surgeries to
treat his cancer, he lost the ability to speak. He lost his voice either
scribble responses on a pad of paper, or type on his Mac and have the awkward
computer voice read it out loud through his laptop speakers.</p>

<p>Cut off from everyday conversation, he poured himself into tweeting, posting to
Facebook, and blogging at <a href="http://rogerebert.com/">rogerebert.com</a> . He ripped
out posts at a breakneck speed, writing thousands and thousands of words about
everything he could think of‚Äîhis boyhood in Urbana, Illinois, his love for Steak
‚Äôn Shake, his conversations with famous movie actors, his thoughts on his
inevitable death. Hundreds and hundreds of people would respond to his posts,
and he would respond back. Blogging became his primary way of communicating with
the world. ‚ÄúOn the web, my real voice finds expression,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

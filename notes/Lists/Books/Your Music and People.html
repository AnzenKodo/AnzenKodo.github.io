<p>Author: Derek Sivers Created time: April 13, 2021 9:01 PM Page No.: 146
Progress: ‚úîÔ∏è</p>

<p>A philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate,
resourceful, and connected.</p>
<h1><a name="what-i-am-going-to-to-do-after-reading-it" class="heading-anchor" href="#what-i-am-going-to-to-do-after-reading-it" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>What I am going to to do after reading it?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make database of people &amp; and how often I should contact them.</li>
<li>Build some persona for people to look up to.</li>
<li>Never give to I am contacting someone.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="points" class="heading-anchor" href="#points" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Socialize

<ul>
<li>How to use friends database?</li>
<li>Every person you‚Äôve ever met has the potential to help you.</li>
<li>A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.</li>
<li>B list: Important people. Contact every two months.</li>
<li>C list: Most people. Contact every six months.</li>
<li>D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have
their correct info.</li>
<li>Normal World &amp; Business World</li>
<li>As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they
don‚Äôt reply, they‚Äôre just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a
total loser.</li>
<li>But in the business world, it‚Äôs the opposite. If you don‚Äôt keep trying,
you‚Äôre a loser!</li>
<li>How to be cool?</li>
<li>But people want someone to look up to. Someone who‚Äôs not of their normal
boring world. Someone who‚Äôs being who they wish they could be, if they had
the courage.</li>
<li>It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but
it‚Äôs considerate and part of your art.</li>
<li>Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only
great at their art, but also knew how to play their image ‚Äî to be cool.</li>
<li>You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them
curious.</li>
<li>Make public persona ‚Äî the image you show the world ‚Äî should be an extreme
character. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.</li>
<li>About People</li>
<li>Are fans telling friends? If not, don‚Äôt promote.</li>
<li>Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a
friend. That‚Äôs how things are done</li>
<li>We love when someone hates the same thing we hate ‚Äî especially if that
thing is popular.</li>
<li>Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with
your existing contacts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business

<ul>
<li>How beat competitor?</li>
<li>Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt try to beat them at their game.</li>
<li>Play a completely different game.</li>
<li>Be radically opposite</li>
<li>Early adopters &amp; Late adopters</li>
<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.
Make sure they stick together as a group.</li>
<li>Now it‚Äôs not about you, it‚Äôs about them. Publicize the group, not
yourself. Make it fun to join.</li>
<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are
having.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what‚Äôs left ‚Äî what hasn‚Äôt been
done.</li>
<li>Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use
Amazon‚Äôs system. Payments? Use Stripe.</li>
<li>If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not
be able to imagine that niche without you.</li>
<li>Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your
attention</li>
<li>My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It‚Äôs more useful to assume that
it‚Äôs all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.</li>
<li>Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.</li>
<li>Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can‚Äôt be trusted</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="meaning" class="heading-anchor" href="#meaning" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Meaning</h1>
<p><strong>Market mindset</strong> - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,
competition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Social mindset</strong> - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,
being a good generous person, doing what‚Äôs right.</p>

<p><strong>Money</strong> - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it‚Äôs proof that
you‚Äôre giving them something valuable in return.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing</strong> - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate
to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.</p>
<h1><a name="stories" class="heading-anchor" href="#stories" rel="nofollow" aria-hidden="true"></a>Stories</h1>
<p>How dealt with the flood:</p>

<p>Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was
completely ignored.</p>

<p>Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she‚Äôd
received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a
second inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.</p>

<p>Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she‚Äôd had the
chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it
in a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare
time.</p>

<p>Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the
third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a
conference.</p>

<p>She‚Äôs an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing
problem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to
get the rights to sell it because they couldn‚Äôt get a response from the
publisher.</p>

<p>The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, ‚ÄúSell it anyway. Don‚Äôt wait for
permission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they
contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.‚Äù</p>

<p>Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.</p>

<p>It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.</p>

<p>Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.</p>

<hr>

<p>Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They
love it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on
music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and
tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.‚Äù
Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing
their instrument, and decide it‚Äôs not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,
and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious
and overwhelming.</p>
